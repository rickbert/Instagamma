		<grb_description>"This burst had several overlapping peaks with a total duration of about 35 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and started XRT observations 140 seconds after the trigger. In the  prompt XRT data an uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. No OC was detected in the initial UVOT data. 

The Gemini-North telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i imaged the GRB field beginning 1.4 hours after the trigger. Images were obtained in riz with GMOS and in YJHK with NIRI. No source was seen in the optical or Y-band images within the XRT error circle. However, JHK bands all showed a source that was seen to fade in two J-band images taken 3 hours apart. The H-K color is 0.1, which suggests a break between Y and J (like GRB 090423) and might indicate a high redshift, around z ~ 8 for this object (GCN 13802)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a duration of at least 130 seconds and showed multiple peaks throughout. Swift began XRT observations 116 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source. No optical counterpart was seen in the initial UVOT data. Later analysis, however, did detect an optical transient that brightened at first, peaking around 900 seconds post trigger. The burst candidate was detected as follows:

Observations from the GROND multi-band imager at La Silla, Chile, showed a bright source within the XRT error circle with magnitude r' = 19.5 +/-0.1. These observations were begun 60 minutes after the GRB trigger (GCN 13795)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single bright pulse lasting about 22 seconds. The location was 63 degrees off the LAT boresight and the burst was bright enough to trigger an autonomous repointing of the satellite. The burst spectrum was best fit with a Band function: Epeak = 162 +/- 8 keV, alpha = -0.76 +/- 0.04, beta = -2.15 +/- 0.06. The burst was localized by the IPN using data from Konus-Wind, MESSENGER/GRNS, Mars Odyssey/HEND, INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS and AGILE/MCAL (GCN 13786).  The Konus-Wind light curve showed a single pulse lasting about 8 seconds, with additional weaker emission lasting until around T0+30 seconds (GCN 13787). 

Swift observed the field of this GRB with the XRT starting 37 hours after the burst and lasting until about 44 hours after. Two uncatalogued x-ray sources were detected within the IPN error box. Both sources had fluxes typical for a GRB, and neither showed obvious signs of fading over the period of the observations (GCN 13790). No optical afterglow was seen with the UVOT during this time (GCN 13791)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a long-duration burst detected by Fermi/GBM and LAT, INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, Konus-Wind, MESSENGER/GRNS, Swift/BAT (outside coded aperture), and Suzaku/WAM. The GBM trigger was delayed due to Fermi passing through a region of high geomagnetic latitude: emission was clearly detected at least 60 seconds prior to the trigger time. The LAT saw a significant increase in high energy photons, above 100 MeV, at the trigger time (GCN 13777). The Konus-Wind light curve showed a multi-peaked structure with a duration of about 30 seconds. A weaker and softer pulse followed at about T0+50 seconds.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This GRB was localized by the IPN, including data from INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, AGILE/MCAL, Konus-Wind and Mars Odyssey/HEND. It was also seen by Fermi in both the GBM and the LAT. The LAT data show a significant increase in counts above 100 MeV starting several seconds after the trigger. The light curve had a single peaked structure (GCN 13756). The GBM did not trigger on this event because of high geo-magnetic latitude. However, the burst was easily detected in ground analysis. It showed a precursor at T0 followed by bright, hard emission 50 seconds later and lasting an additional 40 seconds. The T90 for the burst is about 69 seconds (GCN 13757).

The Konus-Wind light curve for this burst showed a bright, hard pulse lasting about 30 seconds followed by a tail of weaker emission that lasted about 150 seconds. It also saw a soft, weak precursor 55 seconds before the trigger, with emission n the main burst episode seen up to 9 MeV (GCN 13758)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"The light curve for this burst contained one, or possibly two, pulses lasting about 5 seconds total. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began XRT observations 93 seconds after the GRB trigger. A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found 127 seconds from the BAT position and within the BAT error circle. No corresponding UVOT observations were made because an Earth limb constraint forced the satellite to slew away before they could be obtained. 

Observations from the ground did show an optical counterpart. The Skynet system reported a fading afterglow candidate in images from their PROMPT telescopes on Cerro Tololo, Chile. The images began about 4 minutes after the burst and reveal an R = 16.3 object close to the BAT position (GCN 13728). The object was also seen in images from the GROND multi-band imager at La Silla, Chile. In data obtained starting 149 seconds after the trigger, the following magnitudes are reported:

g' = 18.4 +- 0.1
r' = 16.6 +- 0.1
i' = 15.8 +- 0.1
z' = 15.5 +- 0.1
J = 14.8 +- 0.1
H = 14.5 +- 0.1
K = 14.3 +- 0.1.

The VLT/X-shooter was used to obtain a spectrum of the OC starting 1.7 hours after the trigger. The spectrum covered the region from 3000 to 25000 angstrom. Absorption features including Lyman-alpha, Fe II, Ni II, Si II, S II, Al II, Al III, C II, O I, C IV and Zn II were seen at a common redshift of z = 3.93. In addition, fine structure lines of Fe II*, Si II*, O I*, O II** and C II* were seen (GCN 13730)."</grb_description>

Followup observations were made with Swift about 15 hours after the trigger, but no source was seen in 3700 seconds of XRT observations, nor was any optical candidate seen by the UVOT (GCN 13740). The source did trigger the Fermi  GBM. However the trigger occurred more than 4 minutes earlier than the MAXI/GSC trigger. The positions were consistent with each other though, suggesting that the two triggers were from the same object. The GBM light curve showed two spiky pulses with at total duration of about 66 seconds. "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This BAT light curve for this burst showed a single pulse lasting 10 seconds. Swift was not able to slew to the burst for approximately 40 minutes because of an Earth limb constraint. Once the constraint was lifted the satellite slewed and began observing with the XRT about 45 minutes after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle (GCN 13647). 

The GROND multi-band imager at La Silla, Chile, took images of the GRB field 150 seconds after the BAT trigger. An uncatalogued source was seen in all bands (g'r'i'z' and JHK). The preliminary magnitude reported was i'=17.6 (GCN 13648). The VLT/X-shooter also obtained data on the GRB. The VLT measured brightness was R =18.9 at T+1.67 hr. A spectrum covering from 3000 to 25000 angstroms showed many strong absorption lines and a wide trough, assumed to be Lyman-alpha. Metal lines seen included S II, Si II, O I, C IV, Si IV, Fe II, Al II, Al III, Mn II, Mg II, Mg I and others. The common redshift for this systems was z = 2.358. Fine structure lines of Ni II and Fe II are also seen at this redshift, conclusively showing that this is the GRB redshift. In addition, intervening systems are seen at z = 1.539, 1.693 and 2.00, with the first of these showed particularly strong absorption from Mg II, Mg I and Fe II (GCN 13649)."</grb_description>

In the initial data, a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. Near simultaneous UVOT data also detected an object. It had a magnitude m = 18.40 in the clear filter. 

Several ground-based observers reported seeing the afterglow for this burst. The MASTER II robotic telescope detected the afterglow in images obtained beginning 665 seconds after the GRB. The fading object had the following brightnesses (GCN 13623):

The afterglow was also detected by the Gran Telescopio Canario 6.5 hours after the trigger. A spectrum of the afterglow was obtained using the OSIRIS instrument. The spectrum ran from 3700 to 7800 angstroms. The spectrum shows strong Lyman-alpha and -beta absorption, as well as absorption from S II, Si II, O I, C II, Si IV, Al II, Al III, Ni II, Zn II and Si II*, all at a common redshift z = 2.671 (GCN 13628).

		<grb_description>The light curve for this burst showed a single peak with a duration of about 30 seconds. The source matched a catalog object from the Uhuru catalog, 4U 1708-23. The offset between the two was six arcminutes, which is within the uncertainty of the catalog position. As a result, it is not clear if this object was a GRB, the Uhuru source, or some other Galactic transient. Swift did not slew to this object, so no XRT or UVOT data are available. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a long, weak burst detected in the Automated Science Processing of the Fermi LAT (there was no corresponding GBM trigger). The source was detected for 1600 seconds, at which point it exited the LAT window; it was not seen on subsequent orbit, 10000 seconds later. The duration of the burst was therefore between 1600 and 10000 seconds. The spectrum for this burst was described by a power law of photon index -2.3 +/- 0.2. The Galactic coordinates of the burst were l,b = 339.05, -0.003. It was thus seen through the Galaxy, and it is possible that it is a Galactic transient rather than a GRB. Two known Fermi sources are close to this position, though there is a lot of confusion caused by the proximity to the Galactic plane and the large position uncertainty.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted about 25 seconds and showed a single peak in the BAT light curve. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began observing with the XRT 153 seconds after the BAT trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. There were no credible OC candidates in the UVOT data.

Observations from the GROND multi-band imager were obtained beginning 10.5 hours after the burst trigger. A fading source was found in g', r', i' and z' within the XRT error circle. The magnitudes are listed below (GCN 13506):

    g' = 23.8 +- 0.1,
   r' = 23.6 +- 0.1,
   i' = 22.8 +- 0.1,
   z' = 22.6 +- 0.1,
   J  > 21.8,
   H  > 21.2,
   K  > 19.8.

The GROND afterglow is consistent with an SDSS source, and a spectrum of this source was obtained using the VLT/X-Shooter 10 hours after the burst. The spectrum covered wavelengths between 3000 and 25000 angstrom. Several emission lines are seen, including [O II], [O III] and H-alpha, beta and gamma. All lines are at a common redshift of z = 0.9586. Given the superposition of this object with the GRB afterglow, it is likely that it is the GRB host galaxy (GCN 13507)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst was extraordinarily long. It had a very short precursor, lasting only 0.9 seconds. There then followed a long period of quiescence, lasting 170 seconds, followed by the man double-peaked burst which lasted 60 seconds. The total duration was approximately 230 seconds (GCN 13488). The burst was localized by the IPN with data from Fermi/GBM, Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, Suzaku/WAM and MESSENGER/GRNS. 

The burst was also observed from the ground, with several observatories detecting the optical afterglow. The 48 inch telescope at Mt. Palomar in Californa reported the OC at r' = 20.4 in images obtained 1.5 days after the trigger. The same object was detected in images from the Nordic Optical Telescope 2.5 days after the trigger, with a magnitude again at r' = 21.00+/-0.04 (GCN 13490 and 13491). This object was also detected in all bands of the GROND multi-band imager (GCN 13492). Spectra were obtained with the VLT using both the FORS2 and X-Shooter instruments. The FORS2 spectrum showed absorption from Lyman-alpha, Si II, O I and C IV at a common redshift of z = 2.48 (GCN 13493), and the X-Shooter spectrum confirmed these results (GCN 13494).

The afterglow was also detected by the Swift XRT 2.8 days after the trigger (GCN 13495) and by the EVLA 2.5 days after the trigger at 6 and 22 GHz (GCN 13497)."</grb_description>

An optical candidate was reported from the UVOT data (at a corrected position)  with a magnitude m =18.6 (GCN 13473). 

Ground-based observers confirmed the presence of the OC and its fading. Observers at the GROND multi-band imager at La Silla, Chile showed that the OC had faded substantially in the six hours between the burst and their observations. They found the following magnitudes and lower limits:

  g' = 22.3 +/- 0.2

In addition, a spectrum was obtained using the VLT/X-Shooter 7.8 hours after the burst. The spectrum covered wavelengths from 3000 to 18000 angstrom. Absorption and emission was seen from Mg II, along with emission lines of [O II], H-beta, [O III] and H-alpha. These were at a common redshift of z = 0.3984 (GCN 13477)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The light curve for this burst had a single peak lasting about 20 seconds. Swift was not able to slew immediately to the burst because of an Earth limb constraint, which was in effect for 51 minutes. After the constraint was lifted, Swift slewed to the burst and began XRT observations at T+54 minutes. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle (GCN 13466). Additional XRT observations showed the source to be fading, suggesting that this was the x-ray afterglow of the GRB (GCN 13476).

The XRT began observations 123 seconds after the burst, revealing a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. No optical counterpart was detected. Further analysis of the BAT data showed that the light curve had emission beginning around T-100 seconds, that it peaked around T+20 seconds, and then that it slowly decayed out to T+870 seconds. The T90 duration was 60 +/- 19 seconds. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was a long GRB, lasting 135 seconds. It was bright enough to saturate the INTEGRAL telemetry. 

This burst was also detected by the Fermi/GBM. The GBM light curve showed a precursor that was followed by a hard main burst lasting about 50 seconds. The spectrum was best fit by a Band function with alpha = -0.94+/-0.01, beta = -2.40+/-0.04 and Epeak = 973 +/- 35 keV (GCN 13437). 

The field was observed using the PROMPT telescopes at Cerro Tololo, Chile, beginning 37 seconds after the GRB. No afterglow was seen in the initial exposures, but there was a transient detected that rapidly brightened until T+112 seconds. The magnitude reached R = 12.117+/-0.008 (GCN 13430).

Other ground-based observers also detected this burst. A spectrum was obtained from the Gemini South telescope. It showed absorption from Mg II (2797/2804A) and Fe II (2374/3483/2600A) at a common redshift of z = 1.405.

		<grb_description>"There was no real-time notice given for this burst because it coincided with a TDRSS outage. In addition, Moon constraint prevented an automatic slew maneuver. However, the burst was observed by both the Fermi GBM and LAT and by Konus-Wind. The GBM light curve showed a single FRED-like peak lasting about 0.7 seconds. A power law with index -0.83+/-0.2, and peak energy Epeak = 3800 +200/-180 keV was fitted to the spectrum, though a Band function could be fitted as well (GCN 13380).

The Swift BAT light curve shows much more activity than the GBM. Multiple overlapping activity is seen starting 25 seconds before the trigger. Two main episodes are seen between T-10 and T+70 seconds, with a peak around T+35, and then again between T+120 and T+200 with peaks around T+140 and T+170. The data for this burst is then truncated because of a pre-schedules slew to another object. The total duration of the burst is therefore at least 192 seconds (GCN 13384). 

A possible afterglow candidate was observed in VLT/HAWKI K-band observations taken 24.7 hour after the trigger. An object with K ~ 20.8 (based on 2MASS) was seen, and the object was absent in images taken 48.7 hours after the burst (GCN 13391). In addition, XRT observations of the field were taken 2.5 days after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was observed 40 arcseconds from the above reported NIR object. A second source was also seen just outside the error circle at 70 arcseconds from the BAT position and 35 seconds from the NIR source. It was not clear if either source was fading.  Additional observations obtained using the Chandra X-ray Observatory about 5.5 days after the trigger showed the same two sources. Extrapolating the XRT data and comparing to the Chandra data it can be argued that the first source is the GRB afterglow, though uncertainties for this conclusion are large (GCN 13400)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single FRED-like peak lasting about 20 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst, with the XRT beginning observations at 69 seconds and the UVOT starting at 76 seconds. No optical counterpart was seen in the initial UVOT date. However, the XRT detected a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source. 

No optical counterpart was reported for this burst to quite faint limits - r > 24.0, z > 22.5 from the William Herschel Telescope / ACAM were the deepest reported at an early epoch. These observations were obtained 39 minutes after the burst (GCN 13322). Later observations obtained with the Keck I 10 meter telescope on Mauna Kea found two faint sources within the XRT error circle, but it was not apparent that either of them was related to the GRB (GCN 13332). 

In EVLA observations at 21.8 GHz a brightening radio source was detected within the XRT error circle. These observations, taken 1.15 days after the GRB, were in contrast with earlier observations at T+3.6 hours which yielded only upper limits at the same frequency (GCN 13336 and 13343). The radio source was offset from the two galaxies reported in the Keck observations (GCN 13344).

Additional followup observations made with the Gemini North 8 meter telescope on Mauna Kea showed in z-band showed a faint source within the XRT error circle. These images were obtained at 07:03 UT on 20 May, approximately 8 hours after the trigger. The source corresponded to an object seen in WHT images taken 2 hours after those reported above. The object was seen to brighten over the period of the observations, suggesting that it was the GRB afterglow. The object was very weakly visible in I-band images taken at the same time, indicating a very red color, and it was not detected at all in early JHK images taken at UKIRT, suggesting a high redshift rather than a highly reddened object. Spectroscopy from Gemini North / GMOS covering from 5850 to 10100 angstrom shows a faint trace redward of 8700 angstrom, with nothing visible blueward. There are not lines evident due to the low signal to noise, but the lack of emission blueward of 8700 A suggests a redshift z ~ 6.0 (GCN 13348)."</grb_description>

Followup observations were carried out with the Swift UVOT and XRT from 5.9 to 9.2 hours after the burst. A faint x-ray source was found within the MAXI error box. It is not clear that this is related to the GRB, as there is a nearby (15.6 asec) ROSAT source in this region.

		<grb_description>This burst lasted about ten seconds and had a complex light curve. The satellite slewed immediately and began observing with the XRT 95 seconds after the trigger. A bright,
uncatalogued X-ray source was found in the initial XRT data. No corresponding optical source was seen in the initial UVOT data. However, in further observations a source
consistent with the position of the X-ray source was seen. The magnitudes of this source in the various pass bands of the UVOT are (GCN 13248):

A spectrum obtained at the Gemini-North telescope showed the object to have a blue continuum without any obvious absorption features. A nearby galaxy, just outside the XRT error circle,
was also detected (GCN 13245). Additional spectroscopy on this galaxy found it to have a redshift of z = 0.28  based upon emission from H-alpha, O III (5007,4959) and H-beta (GCN 13251).
These spectroscopic results were confirmed with observations from the VLT, which found weak absorption from Mg II in the GRB OC. They also found that the emission lines from the galaxy
faintly overlapped with the position of the OC, suggesting that the galaxy and OC are related (GCN 13257).</grb_description>

The optical afterglow was also seen from the ground. The Faulkes Telescope North obtained images only 4 minutes after the GRB trigger, detecting an object with R = 18.8 +/- 0.3. The Gemini-North telescope was used to obtain images and spectra of the object.

		<grb_description>This was an image trigger, and so no light curve information was immediately available. XRT started observing the field 118 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source. The corresponding UVOT images did not reveal any optical counterpart. Subsequent analysis of the BAT light curve showed that the GRB was already underway when it came into the field of view of the BAT; this occurred during a preplanned slew of the telescope, at T-100. The burst continued out to around T+180, but because the beginning of the burst was not seen it is not possible to quote a total duration for the light curve (GCN 13186). 

Observations of the GRB from the GROND multi-band imager at La Silla, Chile, did show a possible afterglow. The initial set of observations, taken 18.1 hours after the burst, showed a faint point source in four of the seven filters:

g' > 23,
r' = 22.7 +/- 0.2
i' = 21.5 +/- 0.1
z' = 21.0 +/- 0.1
J  = 20.7 +/- 0.2,
H  > 20.7, and
K  > 18.5

A second set of observations were made 1.75 days after the trigger. A pointing error caused the GRB field to fall outside the view of all but the JHK filters. Nonetheless, the object was not detected in this second J image, suggesting that the object seen in the first set of images was indeed the GRB afterglow (GCN 13219).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had 3 peaks and a total duration of about 60 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst, finding a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source within the BAT error circle. The initial UVOT data also revealed a U = 17.92 object. The initial XRT data  was obtained starting 77 seconds after the trigger, with the UVOT U-filter data acquisition commencing at T+140 seconds. 

This burst was seen by many ground-based observers. For example, the TAROT telescope caught the afterglow still visible and fading 45 minutes after the trigger. The brightness at that time was R = 17.5 (GCN 13124). 

A spectrum for the burst was obtained 3 hours after the burst using the Gemini-South telescope in Chile. The spectrum covered wavelengths from 3865 to 6680 angstroms. Based upon absorption of Lyman-alpha, C IV, C II, O I and Si II, the redshift of the afterglow is seen to be z = 2.81 (GCN 13133). This redshift was confirmed using spectra from the VLT/X-shooter (GCN 13134) and Gran Telescopio Canarios /OSIRIS in La Palma (GCN 13146).</grb_description>

A bright, fading, uncatalogued X-ray source was seen in the initial X-ray data. No optical candidate was seen in the initial UVOT data.

A fading source in the field of this GRB was detected in images begun 133 seconds after the burst from the TAROT robotic telescope at Calern Observatory, France. The source brightness was R ~18.2 at T+163 seconds. The object was seen to decay to R = 19.1 in the ~40 minutes after the burst (GCN 13108).

This burst was also seen from the Dolomites Astronomical Observatory in Italy, part of the Skynet network of robotic telescopes. The brightness of the object over the observations is shown below (GCN 13109):

The burst was observed with the Gran Telescopio Canarias using the OSIRIS spectrograph. Four spectra were obtained, each of 600 second duratioin. The spectra covered from 4000 to 10,000 angstrom and were collected 1.8 hours after the GRB. Absorption features of C IV (1548,1550), Fe II (2383) and Mg II (2796, 2804) were seen at a common redshift of z = 1.798 (GCN 13118).</grb_description>

Swift slewed immediately to the burst, beginning XRT observations 75 seconds after the BAT trigger. In the initial data a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source was found. No UVOT source was seen in the initial imaging.
Observations from the Liverpool 2 meter telescope taken about 15 minutes after the GRB trigger revealed a faint, uncatalogued object within the XRT error circle. The object had a magnitude of r = 20.3+/-0.3. The initial dataset did not show any evidence of fading (GCN 13092). However, later reports found a different object, seen in images from CQUEAN in rizY images.
The images were made about 4.5 hours after the trigger and also showed the previously reported object, which is also visible on the POSS plate. No information was available regarding the fading of this new object, nor of its brightness (GCN 13097). Both objects were also seen in images obtained with the GROND multi-band imager. In these images, acquired 3 hours after the GRB trigger,
the first source had a constant brightness of r'=20.3+/-0.2. The second source was fainter, with r'=22.6 and appeared extended, suggesting it might be the host galaxy of the GRB (GCN 13098)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single-peaked FRED structure and a duration of about 12 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began observations with the XRT, finding an uncatalogued X-ray source within the BAT error circle. No object was found in the initial UVOT data.

A possible candidate afterglow has been reported in data taken with the William Herschel Telescope 13 hours after the burst. The source might be slightly extended, but the data are too poor to be certain. The magnitude of the object was z = 23.8 +/- 0.2 (GCN 13055). Confirmation of this source as the GRB afterglow was obtained using the Gemini-North 8 meter telescope. The Gemini images showed the source had faded to z = 24.5 +/- 0.12 at T+23 hrs. The source was not detected to J = 21.1 and K = 19.5 in UKIRT images obtained around the same time, suggesting that the source could be shrouded in dust, which would explain its extreme red color and faintness (GCN 13064)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst was detected by the Fermi GBM and in ground analysis of Swift BAT data, where it had a significance of 8.2 sigma. There was no automated trigger from the BAT, and so no XRT of UVOT data were initially available. The Swift light curve showed at least two peaks, with possibly a third. The total duration was 35 to 40 seconds (GCN 13002).  

A possible afterglow to this burst was detected in GROND images taken 22.6 hours after the burst. The source is slightly outside outside the ToO XRT error circle (cf. GCN 13012). Though the source does not fade between two epochs of GROND observations, it is not visible in DSS images, so it seems to be a new object in the field. Second epoch magnitudes, taken about 48 hours after the burst, are (GCN 13003):

g' = 22.5 +/- 0.3
r' = 21.9 +/- 0.2
i' = 21.9 +/- 0.3

An uncatalogued X-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. No optical counterpart was found in the initial data.

Imaging from the GROND multi-band imager was performed over two epochs. The first was 19.58 hours after the trigger. Exposures were made in all seven bands, of relatively short exposure times of 7.2 minutes in g'r'i'z' and 8 minutes in JHK, but no source was seen. Then, in a second set of much longer exposures (36 minutes) made 1.84 days after the trigger, a faint object was seen, with J = 20.9 +/- 0.2 (GCN 12988). This object was also detected at R = 22.3 using the VLT/X-shooter in observations made 19.83 hours after the trigger. A VLT spectrum detected a continuum redward of ~600 nm, but no emission features. Poor signal to noise prevented identification of absorption lines, so no redshift can be measured for this burst. The lack of blue continuum could be due to an high redshift for the burst or strong redenning of the source. It is not possible to tell which is the case here (GCN 12991)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst lasted about 100 seconds. Followup observations using the Swift/XRT showed a source within the INTEGRAL error circle. Initial observations do not show any fading of the source (GCN 12911). A faint source was found using the William Herschel Telescope (WHT), Gemini  and UKIRT that corresponded to the XRT source. The WHT data show the object at r = 25.00 +/- 0.15 at 7.4 hours after the burst, and Gemini has r = 24.84 +/- 0.09 at 16.10 hours after the burst. Thus, there is not evidence for brightening in this object. However, a second object, slightly outside the error circle, that is seen to brighten from  r = 24.68 +/- 0.09  (WHT) to r = 24.26 +/- 0.06 (Gemini). The object also brightens in the z filter over this period. It was also detected from the UKIRT with K = 18.35 +/- 0.18 (GCN 12912). These two sources, and the fading of the second, are also seen in data from the GROND multi-band imager (GCN 12913).</grb_description>

A bright, uncatalogued X-ray source was found. In addition, the UVOT found an optical afterglow candidate with m = 19.57.

The OC was also seen in ground-based observations. The 1.3 meter PARITEL on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona started observing about 53 seconds after the trigger. In JHKs imaging the object had magnitudes as follows (GCN 12860):

t_mid (m)  exp.(s)  filt  mag    m_err
10.3       560      J     14.35  0.02
10.3       560      H     13.10  0.02
10.3       560      Ks    11.95  0.02

In addition, the GROND multi-band imager observed the field, finding the following magnitudes in its seven filters (GCN 12863):

g' = 18.8 +- 0.1 mag,
r' = 17.7 +- 0.1 mag,
i' = 16.8 +- 0.1 mag,
z' = 16.2 +- 0.1 mag,
J = 15.2 +- 0.1 mag,
H = 14.6 +- 0.1 mag and
K = 14.0 +- 0.1mag

The afterglow was also detected by a number of other observers, including those using the PROMPT telescopes on Cerro Tololo, Chile, who noted that the OC faded for the first 2.3 minutes, then brightened until about 14 minutes after the trigger, after which it returned to fading. They also note that it had red colors, with I-R ~ 1 and R-B ~ 2 (GCN 12864). 

A spectrum was obtained using the Gemini-South telescope. The spectrum covers from 4000 to 8000 angstrom and shows absorption from Al III (1854, 1862), Fe II (2586, 2600), Mn II (2606) and Mg II (2796, 2803) all at a common redshift of z = 1.728. An additional intervening strong Mg II 2796 absorption system is seen at z = 1.212 (GCN 12865). The redshift is confirmed by spectra taken with the 4 meter Shane telescope at Lick Observatory, California (GCN 12866) and the MMT 6.5 meter telescope on Mount Hopkins, Arizona (GCN 12867).

Swift slewed immediately to the burst, with the XRT starting observations 74 seconds after the trigger. A bright, uncatalogued X-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. No optical counterpart was evident in the initial UVOT observations. 

From the ground, many observers reported only upper limits for the brightness of any OC. However, 11 hours after the burst, observations from the Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii using the izJHK filters revealed a  faint object:

i=24.7 +/- 0.2
z=24.7 +/- 0.3
J> 23.0 (3-sigma)
H=22.8 +/- 0.4
K=21.6 +/- 0.3

It was not clear if the object was actually the GRB afterglow, as the chance alignment of so faint an object within the XRT error circle is a possibility (GCN 12843)."</grb_description>

It was not immediately clear if the source was fading (GCN 12716). Swift also conducted UVOT observations at this time. A faint optical source was detected, consistent with the X-ray source. The source had a magnitude of m = 19.34 +/- 0.03 (unfiltered). This source is also present in the DSS (GCN 12717)."</grb_description>

No optical counterpart has been reported from any ground observers. However, the MAXI instrument aboard ISS observed the field about 52 minutes before, and then again 40 minutes after the trigger. The source was marginally detected in each set of observations (GCN 12691).

This source was also detected at radio wavelengths. It was seen at T+1.46 days by CARMA at 93 GHz (GCN 12710) and at 21.8 GHz at T+3.35 days by the EVLA (GCN 12711)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was quite weak, with a light curve lasting about 20 seconds. Swift was unable to slew immediately to the burst because of an observing constraint. The constraint was not lifted until 48 minutes after the trigger. When XRT observations were finally able to be made, at ~T+54 minutes, an uncatalogued X-ray source was seen to lie within the BAT error circle (GCN 12669). Additional analysis of the BAT light curve showed a FRED-like pulse that began about 2 seconds before the trigger, peaked about 6 seconds after, and dropped below background around 60 seconds post-trigger. No optical counterpart has been reported for this burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted about 15 seconds and had a double-peaked structure, with some substructure superimposed.

This field was observed using the GROND multi-object imager on the 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla about 8.5 hours after the burst. A source was found within the SuperAGILE error circle with r' = 19.0, brighter than the DSS limit. The source is not seen on either the DSS red plate or in SDSS  r images (GCN 12668). Subsequent imaging using the StanCam on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) showed that the object had faded in the ~20 hours since the GROND images were taken. This suggests that the object is the afterglow of the GRB (GCN 12675).

A spectrum of the source was obtained using the VLT/X-Shooter about 1.3 days after the burst. The spectra covered from 3000 to 25000 angstrom. The spectrum shows a smooth continuum with absorption from Fe II, Mg II and Ca II, all at a redshift z = 0.478. Weak emission from [O III] and Halpha are also seen at this redshift (GCN 12667). 

This source was also detected by the Swift/XRT in observations done approximately 18 hours after the trigger (GCN 12673)."</grb_description>

A faint afterglow candidate was reported in imaging done using the Gemini-North telescope. The data were taken in r and z about 39 minutes after the trigger. The source had r~23 and was within the XRT error circle (GCN 12657). These sources are also present in the SDSS images of the filed, with magnitudes consistent with those measured at Gemini. Thus they are likely to be candidate host galaxies, but with little or not contribution from the burst itself. Colors suggest that if associated with either of these objects, the burst would have a redshift z &lt; 4 (GCN 12661). These sources were also detected in images taken with the GROND multi-band imager (GCN 12662)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst was unusual in that it caused two BAT triggers, the second one occurring 424 seconds after the first, and with much higher intensity. The initial burst was 324 seconds long. The satellite slewed immediately to the burst and began XRT observations 419 seconds after the first BAT trigger. A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was seen within the BAT error circle. In contemporaneous UVOT observations, an optical source overlying the XRT source with a magnitude of m = 18.1.

The optical afterglow was also reported by ground-based observers. The TAROT 25 centimeter robotic telescope at La Silla, Chile, started observing 358 seconds after the trigger. The source had R ~ 16.2 at T+680 (GCN 12633). The source was also detected in the near infrared, with H = 14.7 +/-0.2, using the REM 60 cm telescope, also on La Sila (GCN 12634). In addition, several other ground-based observers confirmed the presences of the optical afterglow.

As mentioned, this burst was unusual in that it triggered the BAT two times. The emission from the burst peaked around 900 seconds, then dropped after T+1100 seconds. Nonetheless, emission was detectible beyond 10ks after the trigger. The XRT light curve, which extends out to about 25ks (~7 hours) after the burst, shows high variability with many flares present. There was a precipitous decrease in flux after this time, though emission was still detectible. 

The UVOT also observed the afterglow, noting a brightening by 0.6 mag  at the end of the first orbit that corresponded to a flare in the x-ray light curve. The optical counterpart was detected in all seven filters of the UVOT, and the other filters all show complicated, flaring light curves as well (GCN 12641). 

A spectrum of the afterglow was obtained by the VLT/X-Shooter at ~T+18hr. Four spectra, each with 1200 seconds of exposure time, were obtained. They cover from 0.3 to 2.5 micron, with a resolution ranging from 4500 to 7500. The spectra show a smooth continuum in the optical/UV with several absorption features present at correspond to Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Ca II H and K, all at z = 0.677 (GCN 12648)."</grb_description>

Additional observations by Konus-Wind showed a light curve with a hard bright burst lasting about 20 seconds, with weaker emission continuing for another ~65 seconds (GCN 12627). Followup observations by Swift/XRT were carried out about 55 hours after the trigger. Thought the XRT field of view is smaller than the error box of the IPN localization, an uncatalogued x-ray source was detected which is possibly the GRB afterglow. The source was outside the UVOT field of view, but DSS images showed an optical source within the XRT field (GCN 12630).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This short burst had a double-peaked structure and a duration of only 0.6 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began observing with the XRT after 77 seconds. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT light curve. No optical counterpart was found in the initial UVOT data. The limiting magnitude from the UVOT data was b > 20.0 (GCN 12569). 
 
Observations from the NOT in R showed a faint object, with R = 23.1 +/- 0.3 just outside the XRT error box. These observations were taken about 8 hours after the burst. The observers suggest this object is possibly the afterglow or host galaxy of the GRB (12563). These observations are confirmed by a set taken with the TNG (GCN 12570). Additional observations made using the Magellan telescope also showed the object, but at a somewhat fainter level, with r = 23.9 +/- 0.15, suggesting that it might have faded in the ~5.5 hours between sets of observations. Gemini observers reported a similar fading in their observations taken about 17 hours after the burst. The object had faded to r’ = 23.99 +/- 0.11 (GCN 12567). Followup observations from the NOT on the night after the burst also show some evidence for fading between the two nights, suggesting that the GRB light contributed to the galaxy brightness shortly after the burst (GCN 12572).

This burst was also detected by the Fermi/GBM with light curve characteristics similar to those from the BAT (GCN 12573). The afterglow was seen in ToO observations made with the Chandra X-ray Observatory (GCN 12580).

		<grb_description>The BAT light curve for this burst showed several peaks with a total duration of 20 seconds. The satellite could not slew to this burst because of an observing constraint, which was in effect for 49 minutes past the trigger. After the constraint was lifted, the XRT began observing the field, but no x-ray afterglow was detected (GCN 12549). </grb_description>

The XRT began observing the field 65 seconds after the burst, finding a bright, fading, uncatalogued x-ray source. The UVOT also detected the afterglow, with a magnitude of 19.21 (unfiltered). 

The afterglow was also seen from the ground. The PROMPT4 and PROMPT5 telescopes at Cerro Tololo, Chile imaged the field in R and I, respectively, about 15 minutes after the trigger. Their exposures showed the object at R = 19.467 and I = 18.444 (GCN 125235). The GROND multi-band imager on the MPI/ESO 2.2 meter telescope also detected int he afterglow at r’ = 21.3 +/- 0.1 at a time 2.6 hours after the trigger (GCN 12536).

The Gemini-South telescope obtained a spectrum of this object 4.2 hours after the trigger. Their spectrum covers the range from 4160 to 8140 angstroms and shows a damped Lyman-alpha absorber, as well as narrow lines of C IV, Al II and C II at the common redshift of z = 2.893 (GCN 12537). These spectral results were confirmed by a VLT/X-shooter spectrum, with the additional mention of a Mg II absorber at z = 1.998 (GCN 12542)."</grb_description>

Swift slewed immediately to the burst and started observing with the XRT 180 seconds after the trigger. A bright x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. No optical counterpart was found in the prompt UVOT data.

Additional UVOT images also failed to find a counterpart to the x-ray source detected by XRT. However, a faint source was marginally detected in the white filter, consistent with the sources reported by ground-based observers, discussed below (GCN 12446).

A possible optical counterpart was reported from Palomar 60 images. These were done in r’, i’ and z’ approximately 16.9 hours after the trigger. An extremely faint object was marginally detected in i’ at 22.1+/- 0.3 mag. No detections were made in the other filters, so it is not clear that this object is related to the GRB (GCN 12444). This source was confirmed in observations from the Gemini-North telescope in JHK images. The source was detected in all three filters 19.8 hours after the burst.

A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. No optical afterglow candidate was seen with the UVOT imaging. 

Images taken using the Gemini-South telescope in r-band did locate an object within the XRT error circle. The magnitude of the object was r ~ 22.8 in data acquired about 5 hours after the trigger (GCN 12426). This object was confirmed in images taken using the Nordic Optical Telescope approximately 2 hours after the Gemini imaging (GCN 12427) and by GROND multi-band imaging taken about 1.3 hours after (GCN 12428).

A Gemini-South spectrum  covering the range between 3900 and 8100 angstroms showed a single deep absorption feature near 7300A and a  cutoff in the flux near 5500A. Taking these to be from a damped Lyman-alpha system implies a redshift of z ~ 5. Additional absorption features are seen from Lyman-beta, OI (1302), CII (1334) and SiII (1260.5), all at a common redshift of z = 5.0 (GCN 12429). A spectrum obtained at the VLT confirms these lines, and several others, at a redshift of z = 4.9898 (GCN 12431)."</grb_description>

An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. No optical counterpart was detected in contemporaneous UVOT imaging. 

Optical images from the Xinglong TNT telescope in China starting about 8 minutes after the trigger showed a new source within the XRT error circle. The estimated magnitude of the object in the unfiltered images was m = 20.2 (GCN 12377). Images at the MITSuME 50 cm telescope of the Akeno Optical Observatory, Japan also showed a possible afterglow. Images in g and R did not show the candidate, but the earliest I images did show a marginal detection. The images were collected from T+108 seconds to T+348 seconds (GCN 12378). "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst was localized by the IPN, including missions INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, Konus-Wind, Mars Odyssey/HEND and MESSENGER/GRNS. 

The Knous-Wind light curve showed an extremely bright, short pulse with a hard spectrum. This was followed by three overlapping weaker peaks over the subsequent 25 seconds. A weaker decaying phase of the burst continued out to T+250 seconds, at which point the Konus-Wind measurements ceased (GCN 12362). 

In ToO observations  from Swift/XRT taken about a day after the burst a new X-ray source is seen, though it is outside the IPN error box. No fading of the burst was noted over the ~2 hours of observations, but it seems unlikely that a bright uncatalogued x-ray source so close to the IPN burst is unrelated to the burst (GCN 12364).

Ground-based observers reported an optical counterpart for this burst. From the Isaac Newton Telescope on La Palma, Canary Islands a bright point source was seen with R = 19.0 to 19.5 in images obtained 29 hours after the trigger. The object was quite close to the position of the x-ray afterglow seen with Swift (GCN 12365). Additional observations from GROND at about the same time confirmed the presence of the Isaac Newton object in the NIR: J  = 18.7 +/- 0.1. The optical channels did not show the object because of the smaller field of view in those filters: the observations were pointed at the original IPN coordinates, which seem to be slightly off (GCN 12366).

Spectroscopic observations were done using the Gemini-North telescope. The spectrum showed a power-law continuum and absorption features of Mg II (2796A/2804A), Mg I (2853A) and Ca II (3935A/3970A) at a common redshift of z = 0.982 (GCN 12368)."</grb_description>

Approximately ten hours after the trigger a Target of Opportunity observation was made by Swift/XRT. An uncatalogued X-ray source was found within the AGILE error box (GCN 12348). In subsequent imaging done out to five days past the trigger the X-ray source was seen to fade, suggesting that it is indeed the X-ray afterglow of the GRB (GCN 12372).

An optical afterglow candidate was reported with R = 22.8 based upon combining 46 x 120 second exposures from the 1.5 meter OSN telescope of the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain. The mid-time for these observations was 9.59 hours after the burst trigger (GCN 12350). This object was also observed using the GROND multi-band imager on the ESO 2.2 meter telescope, La Silla, Chile. The GROND images showed that the object had r’ = 23.2 +/- 0.1 in images taken 2.5 days after the burst. Thus the object shows no decay over the two days between observations, suggesting that it is not the GRB afterglow (GCN 12356)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"The BAT light curve for this burst was not immediately available, nor could the satellite slew to the burst because of a Moon constraint. No XRT/UVOT data were possible until after September 8. 

The KAIT telescope at Lick Observatory, Mt. Hamilton, California started an automated image sequence approximately 30 minutes after the trigger. A new object was found within the BAT error circle with R = 16 (GCN 12328). This same object was reported as a possible source to the X-ray transient detected by MAXI, a black hole candidate with known optical and radio counterparts. The MAXI observations suggest that this object was likely due to high energy emission from this known source, rather than an actual GRB (GCN 12329).

A Swift Target of Opportunity observations was made starting about 23 hours after the GRB. In 2.9 kiloseconds of observations (~48 minutes) an x-ray source was seen within the IPN error box. There was no known source at the position of this source, though current catalogs do not go deep enough to have included it. No UVOT source was found to v > 19.19 (GCN 12308).

A possible afterglow with R~23.6 was obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) /ALFOSC. The imaging was done in poor weather conditions and brightening morning twilight, so only one image was obtained and it was not possible to determine if the object was fading (GCN 12311).

The 2.4 meter Gau-Mei-Gu telescope in Yunan, China was used to observe the field approximately 19 hours after the burst. The R-band object reported in the NOT observations was not present to a limiting magnitude R~23.9 (GCN 12314). 

No optical afterglow was seen in early times, within the first 5 to 15 minutes, as reported from the ROTSE-IIId telescope of the Turkish National Observatory at Bakirlitepe, Turkey.

A bright, uncatalogued and fading x-ray source was found. The UVOT also detected an optical afterglow candidate in the initial data. The OC had a magnitude of 19.93 (unfiltered).

A spectrum of the OC was obtained using the ESO VLT/X-shooter. The spectrum was obtained 3 hours after the trigger and showed emission lines from [O II], [O III] and H-alpha, and absorption from Mg II and Fe, all at the common redshift of z = 1.348 (GCN 12258)."</grb_description>

Nonetheless, the count rate was large enough to be significant, and when the satellite slewed over and began observing with the XRT 329 seconds after the trigger and x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. The source was close to a known x-ray source, which was only 6.6 arcsedonds away. It was not clear from the initial data whether or not the new source was fading. No optical counterpart was seen in the prompt UVOT data, which was taken beginning 332 seconds after the trigger.

No obvious optical afterglow was reported from ground observations. However, images of the field from the 6 meter BTA revealed one object within the XRT error circle at R = 23.44. Another object was seen just outside the error circle, which corresponds to the second x-ray source seen by the XRT (GCN 12254)."</grb_description>

A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. UVOT observations  also detected an afterglow in the initial data products. The OC had a magnitude of m = 18.03 (unfiltered). The UVOT imaging began 108 seconds after the trigger. 

The optical afterglow was also seen in observations from the ground. The ROTSE-III telescope of the Turkish National Observatory in Bakirlitepe began observing the field 195 seconds after the burst. They detect the OC at m~15.0 (GCN 12229). Additional imaging was done using the Theuringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg 2.1 meter Schmidt telescope beginning approximately 20 minutes after the GRB trigger. R-band imaging showed the OC at the same position as the UVOT source. No information was given about the magnitude of the source in these images (GCN 12230).

A spectrum of the afterglow was obtained using the OSIRIS instrument on the 10.4 meter GTC at La Palma, Canary Islands.The two 900 second exposures and a single 600 second one cover wavelengths from 3600 to 7500 angstroms. The spectra show absorption features from C II, Si IV, Si II, C IV, Fe II, Al II, Al III, Ni II, Zn II and Mn II. Also seen are fine structure Fe II* and Ni II*. All the lines are at a common redshift of z = 1.858. Intervening systems are seen in Mg II absorption at Z = 1.246 and z = 0.745. The spectra were obtained 7.7 hours after the burst trigger (GCN 12234).  "</grb_description>

A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found. In observations begun 75 seconds after the trigger the UVOT also detected an afterglow candidate, with m = 15.80. 

The burst was also seen by Fermi, both in the LAT (GCN 12218) and the GBM (GCN 12221). The LAT observations show emission above 100 MeV to better than 10 sigma significance. The position of the burst was only 6 degrees from the LAT boresight. The GBM light curve had a single pulse lasting 7.3 seconds. 

Ground-based observations from the Faulkes Telescopes in Hawaii and Australia both began at T+110 seconds and T+182 seconds, respectively. An uncatalogued fading source was found coincident to the UVOT position. The magnitude of the source was R = 16.4 at T+28 minutes (GCN 12216). This source was further confirmed from several additional ground-based telescopes.

Spectroscopic observations were made using the Gemina-North telescope and GMOS spectrograph. The observations totaled 3600 seconds and covered from 3800 to 6650 angstroms. Broad Lyman-alpha absorption was seen, as well as absorption from O, C, Si and Al at the common redshift of z = 2.83. At the time of these observations, approximately 22 hours after the GRB, the object had an R magnitude of 22.0 (GCN 12225)."</grb_description>

A fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was seen. No optical counterpart was detected with the UVOT in the initial data. However, subsequent analysis of the image did show an optical candidate with m = 17.80 (unfiltered - GCN 12199).

From the ground, the ROTSE-III telescope located at the Turkish National Observatory, Bakirlitepe, Turkey, began imaging the field 13.8 seconds after the GRB trigger. The unfiltered images showed an object with m = 16.9 that is not present in the DSS of the field (GCN 12197). 

The afterglow was also observed with the Liverpool 2 meter telescope in the R and I bands (GCN 12198):

Spectroscopic observations were done at the Gemini-North observatory approximately 5 hours after the GRB. Using GMOS, a spectrum covering wavelengths from 4000 to 8100 angstroms was obtained. The spectrum shows a featureless continuum except for the presence of a weak double line, interpreted as Mg II (2796,2803). The redshift is z=1.036 under this assumption. Since no other features are seen, it suggests the redshift is between 1.036 &lt; z &lt; 2.7 (GCN 12202)."</grb_description>

This burst was 40 degrees from the LAT boresight at the time of the trigger, and the satellite automatically repointed to put the source closer to the LAT field center. The LAT then observed the source for the following 2.5 hours, subject to Earth limb constraint. The LAT showed a significant increase in emission that correlated  in both space and time with the GBM data. More than 20 photons were seen to have energies in excess of 100 MeV, with the highest energy photon recorded being at 1.7 GeV. The light curve in the LAT had a similar FRED shape to that in the GBM, though the duration was only about 16 seconds long (GCN 12188)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"Swift slewed immediately to this burst, which had overlapping peaks and a duration of about 60 seconds. The XRT began observing the field 80.5 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. No optical candidate was seen in contemporaneous UVOT observations. However, 11 minutes after the first trigger, the BAT triggered on this source again. Since the source was already being observed by Swift’s three instruments, no slew was necessary. The light curve showed a broad hump beginning around T-100s, followed by several overlapping peaks, just as in the first light curve.These had a duration about 40 seconds long. Another peak was seen around T+200s, giving a total duration for this second peak of about 300 seconds - this after the initial burst 11 minutes before.

Ground-based observations of this field were made using the Geminia-South telescope in Chile. In poor seeing and high airmass, a stack of 5 180 second r-band exposures revealed a faint source within the XRT error circle. No information was given on the brightness of this source in the circular (GCN 12128).

Additional ground observations made using the GROND Multi-band Imager on the 2.2 meter MPI/ESO telescope at La Silla revealed a possible afterglow distinct from that reported earlier in GCN 12128. The images, taken 62 minutes after the trigger, showed r’ = 22.15 +/- 0.15 for this new source. It was not possible to determine if the source was fading (GCN 12129). Further analysis of the Gemini images were able to pull out this same source, with r = 22.18 +/- 0.12 (GCN 12132). Followup observations taken four days later with the Gemini/GMOS again detected these same objects and found no evidence that either had faded (GCN 12155)."</grb_description>

Contemporaneous UVOT observations failed to show any optical counterpart to the GRB.

The Fermi/GBM also triggered on this event. The burst was 54 degrees from the LAT boresight, so the spacecraft executed an automatic maneuver to place the target closer to the boresight.

As a result, the XRT was did not begin imaging the field until 434 seconds after the trigger, finding an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT started a 150 second long finder chart exposure starting 437 seconds after the trigger. An optical afterglow candidate was found in these initial images with unfiltered magnitude m~20.13.

Ground-based images were taken at the MITSuME 50 cm telescope at Akeno Observatory in Yamanashi, Japan. These images started about two minutes after the BAT trigger and showed a faint object within the XRT error circle with Rc=18.84+/-0.65 (GCN 12048). Additional observations from the same telescope taken at T+11 minutes showed the OC in Ic as well as Rc and showed further that the object had fallen to Rc=19.8+/-0.2. Images taken using the MASTER II robotic telescope in Tunka, Russia began 73 seconds after the trigger. No OC was detected to R ~15.2. However, the OC was detected in later images at R~19.5+/-0.5 (polarized, GCN 12050).

The fading behavior of the source was confirmed by observations from Terskol Observatory, Russia (GCN 12052) and by additional Swift/UVOT observations (GCN 12057)."</grb_description>

Automatic reporting of the burst was hindered because of the effects of powerful thunderstorms and tornadoes in Alabama (Huntsville).

This field was observed by the Swift XRT as a Target Of Opportunity starting about 16 hours after the Fermi trigger. Two sources were found within the Fermi/LAT error circle. One is a known ROSAT x-ray source and is also seen in the Digitized Sky Survey. We list the coordinates of the second, uncatalogued source. See circular GCN 11984 for the coordinates of the other source and for further information about the XRT observations. In additional observations from Swift/XRT taken approximately two days after the trigger, the first source (seen by ROSAT and DSS) was still detected at the same flux as the initial observations. The second source was no longer seen, suggesting that it was the x-ray afterglow of the GRB (GCN 11989)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted about 50 seconds. The light curve had a complex structure. The satellite was delayed by 12 minutes from slewing to the burst due to an observing constraint. When the XRT was able to begin observing the field, 814 seconds after the trigger, a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found. No optical candidate was found by the UVOT in corresponding exposures.

Imaging from the 1.5 meter AZT-33IK telescope at Sayan Observatory near Mondy, Russia revealed an optical afterglow with R=18.3. The images were taken about 15 minutes after the GRB trigger (GCN 11958). In the succeeding hours several other observatories reported seeing the afterglow, and it was seen to fade from the earlier observations.

Spectroscopic observations were made using the TNG telescope on La Palma, Canary Islands. In a 700 second exposure covering from 3600 to 8200 angstroms a strong absorption feature was detected at 4290 angstrom. This feature was interpreted to be the CIV doublet at 1549 with a redshift of z = 1.77 (GCN 11977). This redshift was confirmed with observations from the 10.4 meter GTC on La Palma. In a spectrum obtained 3.3 days post-burst, absorption from C IV, Al II, Al III, Fe II, Mg II and Mg I were all seen at a common redshift for z = 1.770 +.- 0.001 (GCN 11978)."</grb_description>

Following the lifting of the observing constraint, the Swift XRT began observing the GRB field at T+43.3 minutes. In an exposure lasting ~3.3 hours, an X-ray afterglow candidate was found lying 2.95 arcminutes from the refined BAT position for the burst. No fading was apparent from these first observations (GCN 11947).

This burst was also detected by the Fermi GBM. Its position and duration were consistent with the Swift values, and the GBM showed that the gamma-ray light curve had a fast rise and slow decay (GCN 11952)."</grb_description>

Because of the proximity of the GRB to the Sun, no followup observations will be possible from Swift. It is noted that the position of the GRB coincides with the position of the dwarf lenticular galaxy NGC 404, which is undergoing vigorous star formation (GCN 11909).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst showed multiple spikes in its light curve. Swift slewed to the burst after a 9 minute delay and began observing with the XRT and UVOT. A fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was seen within the BAT error circle in XRT imaging started 544 seconds after the trigger. No optical counterpart was seen in the corresponding UVOT data. The burst duration was 40 seconds.

Ground-based followup was done at the LIverpool telescope beginning 14.85 minutes after the trigger. A faint source was seen within the XRT error circle, with R=20.8+/-0.1 (T+28 min) and I=20.75+/-0.17 (T+33 min). It was not clear if the source was fading (GCN 11585).

Additional observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope at La Palma imaged the field in R staring 74 minutes after the trigger. They note that the object reported in GCN 11585 had faded to R=21.10+/-0.02 in their first exposure, and that in their third it had dropped to R=21.17+/-0.04. This fading behavior suggests that the object is the GRB afterglow (GCN 11859). "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was an  image trigger. As a result there was no information on the light curve available in the initial data release. Swift slewed to the burst and started observing with the XRT after 1475 seconds. An uncatalogued, bright x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. Not optical counterpart was seen in the UVOT images to a limiting magnitude of about 19.6.

Approximately an hour later, at 13:40:41, the BAT triggered again on what seemed to be the same object. It was not clear if this object is a GRB of unprecedented longevity, or if this is a new galactic transient (GCN 11824). 

Ground-based observations from the Gemini-North telescope failed to find any optical transient to a limiting magnitude of R=22.2. The images were taken two hours after the first trigger in very poor conditions due to the presence of clouds (GCN 11825). 

Inspection of a survey field done as part of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) shows a faint object that closely coincides with the XRT position of the x-ray transient seen by Swift. The optical object has a magnitude around R~22 (with large uncertainties). Since these images were taken in 2009 and 2010, it seems unlikely that this object could be associated with a GRB at cosmic distances, and so these data suggest an origin within our galaxy (GCN 11827).

A spectrum of the PTF object was obtained that showed the source to have a redshift z=0.35 based upon emission from Hbeta and OIII (4959, 5007). The high redshift argues against the object being caused by a galactic x-ray transient, though it is possible that a transient is in a chance alignment with the extragalactic object. If a GRB, this would be of an type not seen before (GCN 11833).

The object was also detected in EVLA observations taken about a day after the burst. The observations were done at 4.94 GHz and 6.69 GHz (GCN 11836)

This object was observed by HST on 4 April. The optical source reported above was barely resolved as a galaxy, with the EVLA and IR sources corresponding to the galaxy nucleus. This suggests that the object is not a GRB at all, but some sort of AGN, perhaps a mini-blazar that went into outburst as it disrupted and devoured a star that had strayed too close (GCN 11881). Data were also obtained using the Chandra X-ray Observatory that overlapped significantly with those from HST (starting about an hour before and continuing about an hour after). The source showed bright x-ray emission that varied by a factor of two during the observations (GCN 11886)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had a single pulse and a duration of about 120 seconds. The spectrum was fit by a power law with exponential cutoff. The power law index was -1.17+/-0.04 and the cutoff energy was Epeak=538+96/-70 keV. This source was also see in the LAT, though the typical energy cutoff had to be lowered from 100 MeV to 50 MeV for the object to be seen. The spectrum of the LAT data has a steeper slope than reported by the GBM, which suggests a break in the spectrum between the low and high energy regimes (GCN 11835).</grb_description>

The position of the object remained in the SwiftBAT filed of view from the time of the trigger until the end of the slew. The light curve had a duration of about 18 seconds, with a single FRED profile.

Followup observations with the XRT begun about 7.5 hours after the trigger showed an x-ray source within the BAT error circle. It was not clear from these initial data if the source was fading or not (GCN 11814).

Only faint upper limits were reported from ground-based observations. The GROND multi-band imager was used to observe the GRB field. No optical afterglow was seen to g’>23.1, nor was any object seen in any of the other filters (GCN 11815)."</grb_description>

The satellite slewed immediately to the burst, and the XRT started observing the field 105 seconds after the trigger. A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. No corresponding optical source was found in the initial UVOT data.

The MASTER telescope in Kislovodsk, Russia began observations 89 seconds after the trigger. In the initial 20 second exposure, no optical counterpart was present to magnitude 17.3. Additional images, 25 total, were co-added to reach a limiting magnitude of 20.0. The mid-time for the co-added images was T+3240 seconds (GCN 11791).

Additional ground-based observations were made from the RTT 1.5 meter telescope located at Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey. The observations were made approximately one hour after the burst. 21 observations, each of 300 second duration, were made in Rc. No optical counterpart for the GRB was seen. The limiting magnitude of the combined images was Rc > 23.6 (GCN 11796)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted about ten seconds. It had a flat-topped light curve with a superimposed short spike. The XRT began observing the GRB field 109 seconds after the trigger, finding an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The presence of bright stars in the field preventing UVOT finder chart observations from being immediately available. However, observations taken starting 113 seconds after the burst and continuing for over 8 hours in various filters did not reveal any optical counterpart for the burst (GCN 11779). 

Observers at the GROND multi-band imager at La Silla, Chile, were able to begin observing the field 2 minutes after the burst. A faint source was found, which decayed by 0.8mag over 60.5 minutes, suggesting that this was the GRB afterglow. The source had r’= 23.7 +/- 0.1 at 116.9 minutes after the burst trigger (GCN 11774).

An infrared afterglow was reported from the REM 60 cm telescope at La Silla. Images taken 4.5 minutes after the trigger show an object with H=15.0+/-0.3, but about twenty minutes later the object is no longer visible, with limiting magnitude at H > 16.5 (GCN 11781)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"The GSC instrument on the MAXI scientific payload on the International Space Station triggered on this object. Both its location and its spectral hardness ratio suggested that the object is a gamma-ray burst. Emission was detected for only part of the transit response of the telescope, resulting in large uncertainties in the transient position along the scan direction.

Followup observations using the Swift XRT were made at about 13 hours after the trigger. Three point sources were found within the MAXI error box. Two of the sources had likely associations with known objects, but the third, the brightest of the three, had no known associated object (GCN 11725). 

The Palomar 60 cm telescope imaged the field about 37 hours after the burst. An object near the XRT object was seen with R ~ 19.8, and no corresponding object is seen either in USNO-B1 catalog or the DSS (GCN 11732).

Observers using the Gemini South telescope and Multi-Object Spectrograph obtained a spectrum of the candidate object covering from 3900 to 6700 angstrom. The object had a smooth continuum with a series of strong, narrow absorption lines. These are identified as Mg I, Mg II, Fe II and Fe II* at a common redshift of z = 1.083 (GCN 11736).

The Swift/XRT observed the field starting about 8 hours after the trigger and continuing for about two hours. An uncatalogued X-ray source was found the INTEGRAL error circle. The source was constant over the period of the observations (GCN 11657). The UVOT also observed the field, finding a source with b=21.00+/-0.37 and u = 20.56+/-0.24 (GCN 11662).

The field was also observed from the La Silla 2.2 meter telescope and GROND imager. The data were obtained starting about 6.42 hours after the trigger, and an object with r’ =21.2+/-0.1 was seen. The object was also detected in the other six GROND filters. There was no variability seen in this object, so it is not clear that it is associated with the GRB (GCN 11665).

GROND again imaged the field about 24.6 hours post burst. In 8 minutes of imaging in all seven filters, the source had dimmed by 1.2 magnitudes, to r’=22.4+/-0.1, which supports itsbeing the afterglow of the GRB (GCN 11669).

Similar results were obtained using the ANDICAM on the CTIO 1.3 meter telescope. The object was seen in I, with I =20.6+/-01. Only upper limits were found for J>18.8.

The XRT began observing the field 155 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source. The UVOT also detected this burst. The estimated magnitude of the afterglow was 18.71, unfiltered. 

Thee burst was also seen from the ground. Observers at the TAROT observatory in France began observations 91 seconds after the trigger, finding an R=16.7 object consistent with the Swift source (GCN 11630).

The ROTSE-III telescope at McDonald Observatory in Texas, USA began observing the field 82 seconds after the trigger. A m=17.0 (unfiltered) object was found, and it was reported over the course of several observations to m~14.0 (GCN 11631). The object was also seen to become brighter in TAROT follow-up imaging, increasing to around R=15 (GCN 11632). It was reported to have a magnitude around R=16.06 at T+~15 minutes by observers at the Liverpool Telescope, though additional observations were halted because of poor weather (GCN 11633). The Swift UVOT also detected the flaring activity (GCN 11634).

Spectroscopy using the Lick Observatory 3m Shane Telescope and KAST spectrograph (Mt. Hamilton, CA) was obtained starting about 2h 45m after the trigger. Absorption features of Ly-alpha, OI 1302 and CII 3980 at a common redshift of z~1.98. No features of CIV were seen, nor were FeII 2344,2374 or 2382 seen (GCN 11635). 

A spectrum was also obtained using the FAST spectrograph on the FLWO 1.5 meter telescope. The data were obtained about 4.5 hours after the trigger. While the same Ly-alpha line was seen as reported from Lick, the redshift was slighter larger, at z~2.22. Additional lines were seen at this same redshift: Si II, Si II*, C IV and Al II (GCN 11638). The redshift of z~2.22 was confirmed by observations from the NOT telescope at La Palma, Canary Islands (GCN 11640)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"The light curve for this burst shows a single weak peak lasting about 20 seconds. The XRT began observing the field 140 seconds after the trigger, finding a fading, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. No optical counterpart was found in the initial data from the UVOT taken at roughly the same time.

Ground-based observations taken using the TAROT 0.25 meter robotic telescope at Calern Observatory, France, did not show any afterglow to R~16 to 17. The observations were made between starting about a minute after the trigger and continuing for another five minutes (GCN 11604). However, in images taken with the 2.5 meter NOT telescope at La Palma, Canary Islands about 1.22 hours after the burst, an object is seen with R ~22.2. The object is not present in SDSS images of the field (GCN 11605).

Observations using the VLT/Xshooter starting at about 6.5 hours after the trigger produced a spectrum with broad Lyman-alpha absorption feature as well as absorption from OI, CII, SiIV, CIV, SiII and FeII. All these lines were at a redshift of z=2.339. There was another absorption feature in the spectrum that was thought to be CIV at redshift z=2.20 (GCN 11607).

Additional spectra were obtained using the 4.2 meter WHT on La Palma. The observations started about 2.7 hours after the burst, with the spectra covering from 4500 angstroms to 9400 angstroms. The S/N of the afterglow was not high enough to confirm the VLT redshift, but redshifts of two field galaxies were measured: These were at z = 0.639, with [OII] 3727, Ca II H&amp;K and Hbeta all seen. The galaxy is offset by ~35 kpc from the GRB line of sight. The second galaxy, z =0.109 from Halpha and [NII] was offset by ~50 kpc. Either of these galaxies might have produced absorption features in the spectra obtained of the afterglow (GCN 11608).

This GRB was also seen in the Suzaku WAM instrument, with the x-ray light curve showing a complex, multipeaked structure. The WAM light curve lasted about 6.4 seconds (11609). "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single-peak light curve lasting about 2 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst, beginning observations with the XRT after about 76 seconds. An uncatalogued source was found within the BAT error circle. In a corresponding 150 second finder chart exposure with the UVOT no optical counterpart was seen.

Ground-based optical followup from the Xinglong TNT telescope began about 6 hours after the trigger.16 images were made, each of 300 second duration in R band. Combining all images, a very faint source was detected within the x-ray error box. The magnitude of the source was estimated to be 19.6 +/- 0.3 (GCN 11554). 

The William Herschel Telescope began observing the field 15.5 hours after the trigger, detecting a faint and possibly extended source within the x-ray error circle. The magnitude was estimated as i~22, suggesting a possible fading of the source between these and the Xinglong observations, though the positions of the two objects are only marginally consistent (GCN 11559). 

Followup observations and analysis from the UVOT found no optical afterglow consistent with either the TNT or WHT objects (GCN 11560). "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst showed several peaks in its light curve, lasting a total of about 30 seconds. There was a 3.8 minute delay before the satellite slewed an began observing with the XRT and UVOT. At about 327 seconds after the burst the XRT obtained an image of the field. An uncatalogued X-ray source was seen within the BAT error circle. The UVOT took a near-simultaneous image to the XRT, but in the initial 150 second finder chart image there is no obvious optical counterpart.

The first ground-based followup observations were made using the Xinglong TNT telescope 9 minutes after the burst. No counterpart was seen to a limiting magnitude of R~20 out to around 14 minutes post burst (mean time of observations, GCN 11528). Observations from the Liverpool Telescope at around the same time put similar limits on the afterglow brightness (GCN 11537). 

The William Herschel Telescope began observing the field about 3 hours after the burst. The i-band observations showed a faint extended source, i~22.5. The data did not clearly show a point source on top of the extended, one, but this magnitude is marginally brighter that the SDSS magnitude, so it is possible that a contribution from the GRB afterglow is responsible (GCN 11534). 

The Gemini-North telescope observed the field about a day after the burst, obtaining a spectrum of the faint galaxy in the XRT error circle. The spectrum covered from 3900 to 8100 angstrom. Emission from [O II], H-beta and [O III] are all present at a common redshift of z =0.618 (GCN 11538). In addition, subtraction of the earlier WHT image from the Gemini-N image reveals a fading source, presumably the GRB afterglow (GCN 11540)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This light curve lasted about 4 seconds. It had a double peaked structure. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began observations withe XRT 106 seconds after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found in the promptly available data. The UVOT imaged the field at approximately the same time, but in the initial 52 second finder chart exposure no optical counterpart was seen.

Observations from the TNG 3.6 meter telescope in the Canary Islands showed a faint object within the XRT error circle. The obect had R~24.5 and was also detected in I. There is also a galaxy just outside the XRT error circle with R = 18.2. It was not clear whether any of these sources was variable in the initial set of observations, acquired about 4.4 hours after the trigger (GCN 11524). Refinements of the X-ray position (GCN 11526) placed the faint object well outside the XRT error circle, but it moved the error circle to include edge of the galaxy mentioned previously (GCN 11524). A spectrum of the galaxy taken at the TNG 5.6 hours after the trigger over the wavelength range 3800 to 8000 angstrom revealed emission features of H-alpha, [NII] 6583, [SII] 6730 and H-beta at a redshift z = 0.093. Also seen are C H&amp;K in absorption at the same redshift. While this galaxy does overlap the XRT error circle, it is only the outer stellar light that is included. The center of the galaxy is well outside the error circle, 7.3 kpc in projection. This is a large distance for a long duration GRB, typically the type associated with young stellar populations (GCN 11530)."</grb_description>

The XRT began observing the GRB field 149 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source. A contemporaneous 150 second finding chart exposure with the UVOT also revealed an afterglow candidate at m=17.93. 

Ground-based optical observations were completed using the 50 cm MITSuME telescope at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory. The observations were done in g’, Rc and Ic about 1.3 hours after the burst trigger. The afterglow was seen in all three filters, with magnitudes as follows (GCN 11513):

g‘	=	20.0 +/- 0.4
Rc	=	19.6 +/- 0.3
Ic	=	18.3 +/- 0.2

The burst was also seen by the Fermi GBM. The Fermi light curve started around T0-123 second, and the total duration was about 254 seconds (T90). The GBM saw several peaks for this GRB, unlike the two seen with the Swift BAT (GCN 11512)."</grb_description>

The satellite slewed immediately to the burst, but due to the delay between the start of the image interval (the trigger time) and the onset of XRT observations is more than 23 minutes. Nonetheless, the XRT found a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle.  Subsequent observations with the XRT showed that the source faded. It’s decay followed a power-law with index 1.108+/-0.011. In addition, the UVOT also detected the  afterglow at quite faint magnitudes, below about 20 to 21 in the B and UV filters (GCN 11499).

Analysis of the BAT data for the burst showed that it entered the BAT field of view at about T-80 seconds. This happened during a pre-planned slew of the satellite. The flux declined from this point, and then increased at ~T+600. Fluctuations of low significance continued out to about T+1300 seconds (GCN 11500). 

This object was observed by several ground-based optical telescopes. The earliest observations were obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) which detected an R=22.1 object about 1.5 hours after the trigger. In approximately four hours between their first and second epoch observations they report that the OC faded by about 0.5 mag in R, while remaining mostly constant in I (GCN 11495 and 11496). Additional observations at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) had faded further in R by the next day. 

A spectrum obtained at WHT of the source from 5000 to 9300 Angstrom did not show any absorption or emission lines, nor any continuum breaks, suggesting a redshift z &lt; 3.1 (GCN 11502). This featureless continuum was confirmed and extended blueward to 3175 Angstrom by MMT observations. The optical spectrum was fit by a power law with spectral index 0.4, bluer than is typical for a GRB afterglow (GCN 11507). 

A break in the optical light curve was seen in NOT data, with the fading rate having increased about five days after the trigger (GCN 11508)."

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single short spike, lasting only 0.5 seconds. Some later activity was also possible, but it was not certain. Swift slewed to the GRB site and started XRT observations 78 seconds after the trigger. No x-ray source was found in the initial analysis, nor was any optical source seen in contemporaneous UVOT observations. The BAT position is close to the galactic plane, so this source might be a new Galactic transient rather than a GRB.

Subsequent inspection of the XRT data showed a faint source within the BAT error circle. However, the data did not allow any determination to be made about whether or not the source was fading (GCN 11485). Subsequent observations lasting more than two hours showed that the x-ray source did indeed fade: it was observed during the first orbit of the spacecraft, but was not detected any time afterward (GCN 11488). This burst was also detected by the Fermi/GBM (GCN 11489)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was a image trigger, so there was no BAT light curve. Subsequent analysis showed a broad peak that started 20 seconds after the trigger and ended 60 seconds after. However, a pre-planned slew of the satellite meant that the GRB field did not come  into view until just before the trigger. It is possible that there were additional light curve features that were missed. Observations with the XRT began 146 seconds after the trigger. A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. In addition, a 150 second finder chart exposure from the UVOT revealed a candidate afterglow with m ~ 17.84. 

The GBM on Fermi also saw this burst. The GBM light curve has a single peak lasting 51 seconds (GCN 11477).

From the ground, the GROND multi-band imager began observing the GRB field 8.1 hours after the trigger. The field was high in the sky at the time of the observations (airmass = 1.05). The afterglow candidate seen in the UVOT data was confirmed. Though it had faded significantly, it was still detected in all seven GROND bands:


g' = 20.4 +/- 0.1
r' = 20.0 +/- 0.1
i' = 20.0 +/- 0.2
z' = 19.6 +/- 0.1
J = 19.2 +/- 0.1

K = 18.6 +/- 0.1

Additional observations made about 2.5 hours later showed that the OC had faded by about 0.3 mag in r’ and J (GCN 11478)."</grb_description>

Additional images raised the limit to m>17.2 in the first 90 seconds after the trigger (GCN 11462). Subsequent observations using larger aperture telescopes did not detect any afterglow, but Gemini-South images taken in i-band about 45 minutes after the trigger did show a faint extended object within the XRT field (GCN 11464). Additional imaging using the Magellan telescope in J-band revealed the same object, with J~21.6.

		<grb_description>This burst was a single burst with a slow rise time and duration of about 10 seconds. No XRT/UVOT data were available because the burst was detected in ground-based analysis of BAT data after the fact.

In follow-up observations with the XRT/UVOT taken about 35 hours after the burst a source was found by both instruments within the BAT error circle. It was not clear if the source was fading. The UVOT source had a magnitude of v=20.28 (GCN 11442).

Additional observations from the ground using the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) confirmed the presence of the source, but were also unable to determine if it was fading. The observations were done about a day and a half after the burst (GCN 11444).

The GROND multiband imager also imaged this OC. The observations were done 2.2 days after the burst, and they showed that the OC had faded by about 0.6 magnitudes in the time since the VATT observations. Furthermore, their seven filters allowed them to make a spectral fit which showed a power-law shape to the spectral energy distribution. Therefore, it seems that this source is the afterglow of the GRB (GCN 11445). </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was detected in Swift/BAT ground analysis. It was also detected by the Fermi/GBM (trigger 312890511). There was no prompt XRT/UVOT data obtained with Swift, but a target of opportunity request was made. The burst had a duration of about 79 seconds. It had 3 overlapping peaks, though the BAT only showed about 50 seconds of the middle one (Fermi/GBM light curve was much more complete).

Observations with the GROND multiband imager at La Silla, Chile found a bright, uncatalogued object within the BAT error circle. The source was detected in all seven GROND bands. The r' magnitude was 19.67+/-0.01 in images taken 14.6 hours after the trigger. The source then faded by 0.3 magnitudes in the first 90 minutes of GROND observations. Detection in all seven GROND bands implies that the source is at a redshift z less than about 3, given the reddening in the direction of the source (GCN 11430). </grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst was detected by ground-processing of the data, as the actual even trigger was terminated prematurely because of a slew maneuver to another source. The burst had a single FRED peak that started before the designated T0, peaked at T)+2 and ended after T0+10. The duration is therefore longer than 10 seconds, but the BAT data are not complete enough to give the entire duration. XRT data of the burst was obtained between about 20 hours and 25 hours after the burst. They show an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. There is weak evidence for fading in these data.

This burst was also detected by Konus-Wind. It showed the same bright peak detected by the BAT, but also showed two weaker peaks preceding it. The first was at ~T0-100 seconds and the second at ~T0-50 seconds.  Together with the main burst these suggest a duration longer than 110 seconds (GCN 11408). 

No optical counterpart was reported. Upper limits from the La Silla 2.2 meter MPI/ESO telescope and GROND multiband imager were fainter than 21.8 in g’ and i’>21.7 (see GCN circular 11409 for limits in other five filters)."</grb_description>

The afterglow was also seen by the BOOTES-2/TELMA 0.6 meter robotic telescope in Malaga, Spain. These data show that R~18 for a mid-exposure time 156 seconds after the GRB trigger (GCN 11398).  Additional ground-based optical telescopes also detected the afterglow of this GRB.

This burst was observed by the Swift XRT, which found a fading x-ray source in observations made from ~1:42 hrs to ~5 hrs after the trigger (GCN 11399).

The Fermi GBM also triggered on this burst. It measured a duration of about 9 seconds total, with a weak peak preceding the stronger, short trigger peak (GCN 11403). Konus-Wind also triggered o this burst, measuring a duration of ~15 seconds (GCN 11400).

		<grb_description>"This burst occurred during a preplanned slew of the Swift satellite. As a result, Swift did not trigger until the burst had been going for more than a minute. The light curve shows a bright peak that happened about 70 seconds before the trigger, then another outburst about 10 seconds before that had two overlapping peaks and lasted about 80 seconds. It is possible that Swift could have missed earlier emission from the burst, before T-100 seconds, due to this preplanned slew. The XRT began observing the GRB field 66 seconds after the trigger. A bright, fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. No object was seen in the initial UVOT images taken at roughly the same time. Subsequent analysis of the UVOT data put limits of m > 20.32 (unfiltered) in the  first ~4 minutes after the trigger (GCN 11389)

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted more than a minute and had a small initial pulse followed by a much larger FRED-like pulse at T+55 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst, beginning XRT observations 85 seconds after the trigger. A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was seen within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also imaged the field, but no OC was seen to m ~ 19.6 in the initial data analysis.

Fermi’s GBM also triggered on the burst (GCN 11376).


Ground-based observations taken from La Silla, Chile, using the 60 cm REM telescope did not detect any OC. These images were taken in H-band 37 minutes and 63 minutes after the trigger. Limiting magnitudes were H~14.8 and H~ 15.5 for the images, respectively (GCN 11364).

Observations using Gemini-South/GMOS were taken starting about 1.8 hours after the trigger, with additional images collected about an hour later. A fading source was found with r~20.5 in the first set of images, and fading by ~0.38 magnitude by the second epoch (GCN11366). 

The afterglow was also detected using the GROND multiband imager in all seven bands. Data collected 1.2 hours after the burst showed the following magnitudes (GCN 11369):

g' = 21.16 +/- 0.04
r' = 20.50 +/- 0.02
i' = 20.00 +/- 0.02
z' = 19.59 +/- 0.02
J  = 19.08 +/- 0.04
H  = 18.76 +/- 0.06
K  = 17.64 +/- 0.06

The OC was also detected using the University of Tokyo 1 meter Atacama Telescope on Cerro Chajnantor, Chile. The JHK observations began about 3 hours after the burst, and the afterglow was detected in all three bands (GCN 11379):

XRT observations were started about 53 minutes after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was seen within the BAT error circle. In contemporaneous UVOT observations, no OC was detected (GCN 11319).

The 1 meter SAO, RAS in Russia was used to image the field between about 1.5 and 2.5 hours after the burst. The images revealed three sources not present in the DSS plates. The sources are all quite faint, with Rc magnitudes ranging from 20.84 to 21.03 (GCN 11324). Further imaging using the ESO 2.2 meter telescope and GROND multiband imager nearly 8 hours after the trigger also detected these sources, and they showed that one of them was fading, having dimmed 0.7 mag (GCN 11326).

		<grb_description>"This burst had a detection significance below that needed for an automated notice to be generated, so it was discovered in later processing of the data (the GCN notice went out nearly 80 minutes after the burst). The burst lasted about 60 seconds.

The burst was observed by Swift as a Target of Opportunity about 3.2 hours after the INTEGRAL detection. A faint source was seen in the XRT data. No UVOT source was seen (GCN 11261). Subsequent observations taken about 7.2 hours after the INTEGRAL detection seemed to suggest that the source had faded, but the number of counts was too low to be certain (GCN 11268). 

Remarkably, ground-based observers did report seeing a possible afterglow, even with the delay in the reporting of the burst. The Faulkes-North Telescope was used to image the GRB field 1.6 hours after the trigger. Within the Swift-XRT error circle an uncatalogued object was found. This object was possibly fading. At T+2.07 hours it was at R=21.6+-0.2, and at T+5.05 it had dropped to R=22.1+/-0.2 (GCN 11265). Additional observations were done by observers using the Nordic Optical Telescope. The observations were carried out 19.4 hours after the burst, and using the same comparison star as the Faulkes observations derived a magnitude of R=23.2. (GCN 11269). The confirmation of the source and its fading indicates that this was indeed the GRB afterglow."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was a long burst, lasting 130 seconds. Its light curve consisted of many bright peaks over that period. The satellite slewed and began observing with the XRT 80 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, fading uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also found a source in U images begun 146 seconds after the trigger. It had a magnitude estimated to be U = 14.90. This UVOT source is possibly associated with a bright flare seen in the x-ray light curve at T+120 seconds.

The earliest reported ground-based observations of the burst are from the MASTER robotic telescope at the Krylov Observatory of Moscow State University, Russia. They report seeing a bright optical transient 43 seconds after the GRB trigger, though they give no magnitude information for their observations (GCN 11228).  The Faulkes-North telescope observed the field about 3.5 minutes after the burst, finding an R=15.5 +.- 0.1 magnitude object (GCN 11229). 

A spectrum obtained using the Gemini-N/GMOS on Mauna Kea, HI approximately 40 minutes after the GRB showed absorption lines of CIV (1458, 1551), FeII (2344, 2374, 2383) and others, all at a common redshift of z = 1.727 (GCN 11230).

		<grb_description>This burst had a two-peaked structure and lasted about 30 seconds. Because of a Sun constraint the telescope was not able to slew to observe with the XRT/UVOT. The proximity of the burst to the Sun prevents such observations until November 7, so there will not be any XRT/UVOT data for this burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had an unusual light curve. It started with a small pulse or spike around the time of the trigger. This was followed about 150 seconds later by a brighter spike, and then another bright spike 50 seconds after that. The peak count rate actually occurred 210 seconds after the trigger! The XRT began observing the field 316 seconds after the BAT trigger, finding a bright and fading uncatalogued x-ray source. In an unfiltered exposure from the UVOT taken 325 seconds after the burst, no optical counterpart was seen to a limiting magnitude of m ~ 18.

No optical counterpart was reported from any ground-based followup observations.

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted about 10 seconds. It’s light curve was composed of a single symmetric peak. The XRT started observing the field 161 seconds after the burst, finding an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. Observations from the UVOT were begun 147 seconds after the BAT trigger, and in the initial images a candidate afterglow was found with a magnitude of 19.67. 

The OC was seen by several observatories on the ground, the earliest reports coming from the MASTER robotic telescope of the Moscow State University’s Krylov Observatory. Unfiltered magnitudes at 101 seconds past the burst trigger were around m ~ 16 (GCN 11161). A spectrum obtained from the Gemini-North telescope. It showed many absorption systems, with the highest redshift one composed of Fe II, Al II and Si II all at z = 1.408 (GCN 11164).

The afterglow from this GRB was also seen in the radio. The Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands detected the afterglow at 4.9 GHz in observations done about 2.5 days after the trigger. In subsequent observations 5.5 days after the GRB trigger the radio source had brightened since the first set of observations (GCN 11256). The radio afterglow was also detected with the Extended VLA radio telescope in New Mexico, USA on Sept 6.47, approximately 5 days after the trigger. The observations were carried out in C-band (4 to 8 GHz), and detections were made at 4.5 and 7.9 GHz. Flux densities (brightnesses) were 331+/-30 Jy and 440+/-27 Jy in the two bands, respectively (GCN 11257)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted 25 seconds. It had a FRED-like light curve. Observations with the XRT and UVOT began 69 and 77 seconds after the trigger, respectively. The XRT detected a bright, fading, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. No optical counterpart was found in the initial UVOT imaging. The limiting magnitude was m ~ 18. 

Observations done 7.2 hours after the burst with the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma showed a possible optical counterpart. However the z-band images showed two sources close to the XRT object; one was visible in archival DSS plates, and the other was not, but was offset from the XRT source by 6 arcseconds. It was not clear if they were the same. The fact that the WHT object was not seen in DSS plates could have been due to the different filters used for the two observations (GCN 11138). However, subsequent observations (5 hours after the first set) showed the same two objects at the same brightness within errors. Therefore it is likely the case that neither is related to the GRB (GCN 11142).

Spectroscopy of one of the sources from the VLT/X-shooter revealed it to be an M-dwarf star (GCN 11143).

Additional ground-based observations from the WHT approximately 8 hours after the burst revealed a faint object within the XRT error circle in addition to the two objects mentioned previously. The object had a K magnitude of 19.6. It was faintly visible in H, but was not seen in J or z, making it extremely red. The observers suggest that this object is the GRB afterglow (GCN 11145). 

Subsequent analysis of the early UVOT data showed that this source, originally misidentified as one of the two WHT sources mentioned earlier, did in fact fade slightly at early times (in unfiltered and u images). It then reached a steady brightness. This suggests that the third source from WHT was indeed the GRB afterglow (GCN 11148). "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single symmetric peak. It lasted approximately 2 seconds. The satellite slewed immediately to the GRB field, starting XRT and UVOT observations at T+83 seconds and T+91 seconds, respectively. The XRT found a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also detected the source, with preliminary unfiltered magnitude of 17.00.

The UVOT afterglow was confirmed by observations with the TNG 3.5 meter telescope on La Palma. The observations began 2.8 hours after the burst and revealed an object with R~20.5 coinciding with the UVOT source (GCN 11104).

The NOT/ALFOSC was used to image the field in R starting about 24 hours after the burst. The OC was detected at R = 23.0 +/- 0.1, as was the likely host galaxy at R = 21.65 +/- 0.05 (GCN 11120). 

The Liverpool Telescope imaged the field in R and I, finding that the OC had brightened to R = 19.75 +/- 0.2 at ~3 days post trigger. Contemporaneous images showed I = 18.32 +/- 0.04 at this time (GCN 11122).

Imaging and GMOS spectroscopy from the Gemini North telescope confirmed the early fading behavior of the source (GCN 11109) and provided a redshift based upon O III 4995/5009 and Hbeta (4861) at a redshift of z ~ 0.245. The observers note that the redshift is tentative because their spectrum had quite low signal to noise (GCN 11116).

Subsequent spectroscopy using the VLT/X-shooter arrived at a different redshift from the Gemini results. Based upon emission lines of Halpha, Hbeta, OII (3727), NII (6548/6583) and OII (5007) in emission. Absorption was seen from Ca II H&amp;K. The system has two redshifts, corresponding to different sources: One is at z = 0.8034 and the other is at z = 0.8049. Reanalysis of the Gemini/GMOS spectrum by this same group identified faint absorption from Mg II (2797/2803) and FeII (2600), both at a redshift of z = 0.8035, consistent with the VLT redshifts for the emission lines, none of which were within the GMOS spectral window (GCN 11123). Observations from the GTC on La Palma confirmed the Mg II absorption at a redshift of z = 0.8049. The emission lines were not within the spectral window  and so could not be confirmed (GCN 11125).

A spectrum of this source was obtained at the Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas. The spectrum, obtained an hour after the trigger, showed lines of All III, Fe II and Mg II, all at a redshift z = 1.44 (GCN 11089). The source was also observed at several other ground-based observatories. In fact, the afterglow was still visible in images taken 2.65 days after the burst using the 1 meter Lulin telescope. The magnitude at that time was R ~ 19.2 (GCN 11118). 

In addition, observations were undertaken at 345 GHz using LABOCA/APEX, but no afterglow was seen (GCN 11098).

In the XRT data a fading, uncatalogued x-ray source is seen. The UVOT data also showed the afterglow. These data were obtained at T+126 and T+129 seconds, respectively.

The Palomar 60 inch telescope observed the field approximately 3 minutes after the trigger in r’, z’ and i’. An object with R [sic] = 17.3 was seen at the edge of the XRT error circle (GCN 11050). Subsequent monitoring showed that the source faded significantly, thus it was the GRB afterglow (GCN  11051).

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single peak and lasted about 10 seconds. The satellite slewed immediately and began observing with the UVOT and XRT. In observations started 97 seconds after the burst the XRT found no x-ray source in the first 2.5 seconds of exposure.  A hint of a source was seen in 80 seconds of WT data. In a reversal of the more typical case, the UVOT saw an optical counterpart where the XRT found nothing. The UVOT imaging began 100 seconds after the trigger, and the source had an unfiltered magnitude of 17.30.

The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory, California, began observing the GRB field less than a minute after the trigger. An object with I = 18.7 +./- 0.3 was seen 95 seconds after the BAT trigger. Observations were also made with the nearby 1 meter Nickel Telescope, which also detected the afterglow. The OC was seen to fade over the course of the observations (GCN 11007,11010). 

The Nickel Telescope observations provided the following magnitudes (GCN 11025):

2197      120    R = 18.99 +/- 0.11


This burst was also detected by four of the six PROMPT telescopes at CTIO, Chile. The observations started 45 seconds after the trigger and showed the following (GCN 11008, 11011):

I    =    4.62 +0.08 -0.07
R = 15.24 +0.07, -0.06
V = 15.78, +0.08, -0.07

Observers also report detecting the optical counterpart using the GROND multi-band imager on the 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla in Chile (GCN 11013):

J = 16.4 +- 0.1
H = 16.2 +- 0.1
K = 16.0 +- 0.1

A spectrum of this burst was obtained using the X-shooter on the ESO VLT beginning about 22 hours after the burst. The spectrum covers the spectral range from 300 nm to 2500 nm. Technical problems with the spectrograph rendered the signal to noise lower than usual. However, absorption from Lyman alpha and Mg II at a common redshift of z = 2.106 were detected (GCN 11317).

Observers from the ground observed the field, and an afterglow was reported in images taken using the GROND multi-object imager on the La Silla 2.2 meter telescope (GCN 10969). In addition, the object was seen to fade over a ~half hour period between GROND observations by 1.3 magnitudes (GCN 10970). 

A spectrum obtained using the VLT/X-shooter 11 minutes after the burst showed absorption lines of F II  2344, 2383, 2586,2 600 , Mg II (2796, 2803) and Mg I 2852 all at a redshift of z = 1.288.

The Fermi/LAT also detected this burst. The object was 90 degrees off the LAT boresight, so non-standard analyses had to be used. The LAT showed a single sharp pulse with a gradual decay, similar to the GBM light curve. The total burst duration seen by the LAT was less than 30 seconds, but it’s possible this is due to the noisier data in the LAT, with the background swamping the late-time signal.</grb_description>

No OC was found in 150 second unfiltered images taken by the UVOT starting 56 seconds after the trigger.

Observers at the Gemini-South telescope in Chile reported possible detection of the afterglow in a 600 second r-band image taken approximately 12 hours after the burst. The object in question had r ~ 23. Poor seeing prevented determination of whether this object was the afterglow itself or the GRB host galaxy (GCN 10887). Subsequent observations 63 hours after the burst using GMOS found the same object, which had not faded since the first set of observations. This suggests that the object is the host galaxy (GCN 10905).

The Gemini object was also observed using the Magellan telescope and PANIC IR detector at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The observations were done 39 hours after the burst and revealed a “mildly extended” object in J-band. (GCN 10897)

These magnitudes are based on GROND zero-points and 2MASS field stars. They have not been corrected for Galactic extinction. This source is present in the DSS2 images, and there was no fading apparent over the course of these observations. Thus it is likely that the source is the GRB host galaxy. (GCN 10874). 

Additional ground-based imaging was carried out using the SIRIUS/IRSF 1.4 meter telescope in South Africa. The images, in JHK bands, began about an hour after the trigger and continued for nearly an hour. A new source was seen, and it brightened by ~ 1mag in all bands. Reported photometry is in the table (GCN 10881):

A spectrum of this object was obtained using the X-shooter spectrograph and ESO VLT. The spectra covered from 3000 to 25,000 angstroms. Based upon emission from OII, H-beta and OIII a redshift of z = 0.542 was found. The wavelength solution was based on archival data, so there could be small offsets to the wavelengths (GCN 10876)."</grb_description>

The burst was also detected by  the Fermi/GBM, and the duration (T90) from that set of data was 24.6 +/- 0.5 seconds (GCN 10811).

The burst was also observed by the Swift XRT and UVOT. These observations started about 12 hours after the burst. They revealed a bright source within the AGILE error circle. Though the x-ray source was not observed to fade over the ~1.5 hours of pointed observations, it is not present in the ROSAT survey image of the field, nor was it present in an XMM data set that covers the field. The source was also seen in the UVOT, having an unfiltered magnitude of m = 20.96 +/- 0.13 (GCN 10813).

The burst afterglow was also detected using the GROND multi-band imager on the 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla, in Chile. The observations were undertaken 54 hours after the burst, and the OC was seen in all filters, as shown below (GCN 10815):

They showed a bright and fading uncatalogued x-ray source. No counterpart was found in the initial UVOT data to a limiting magnitude of m ~ 18.5. The UVOT observations began 73 seconds after the trigger.

The Fermi/GBM also detected the burst. Their observations are consistent with those from the BAT in terms of both position and duration. They saw the same initial set of peaks lasting about 5 seconds, followed by a second set that began at about T+25 and lasted until about T+40 (GCN 10790). 

Observers from the ground were not able to detect the burst. The earliest observations came from the 0.6 meter TELMA robotic telescope at the BOOTES-2 astronomical station in Málaga, Spain.

		<grb_description>"This was a FRED burst with a duration of about 30 seconds. It was initially detected by INTEGRAL, with observations being taken up by Swift about 2.6 hours after the INTEGRAL trigger. The Swift/XRT found an uncatalogued x-ray source within the INTEGRAL error circle (GCN 10775). Observations continued for approximately 2.5 hours, during which time the x-ray source was observed to fade according to a power-law decay with index 0.68+1.00/-0.96 (GCN 10780).

The GRB afterglow was seen optically from the ground. The 2 meter Faulkes-North Telescope was used to detect the afterglow beginning 4.2 minutes after the burst and continuing for nearly four hours. The afterglow was detected in both R and i (no mention of detections in B and V, which were also employed), and its brightness decayed according to a power-law with index 0.7+/- 0.1, consistent with the decay seen in the x-ray band. The OC was initially detected with R = 19.4 +/- 0.1 at about 5 minutes after the INTEGRAL trigger (GCN 10779).

The GROND multi-band imager also detected the OC. In images beginning about 22 hours after the burst, the afterglow was seen in three filters in the red and NIR part of the spectrum:

g' > 25.3
r' = 23.8 +- 0.1
i' = 23.6 +- 0.2
z' = 23.5 +- 0.2

The magnitudes reported are measured from stacked images with a total integration time of 50 minutes (GCN 10782)."</grb_description>

XRT imaging of the field began 101 seconds after the trigger, and a bright, fading new x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. UVOT images obtained around the same time did not reveal any optical source. 

Initial observations from the ground taken with the MASTER telescope in Russia did not find any OC to m > 17.0 71 seconds after the GRB trigger (GCN 10763). Similarly, images obtained with the 2 meter Faulkes Telescope South did not reveal an afterglow to R > 20.3 and i’ > 19.5. The images were made about 35 minutes after the trigger (GCN 10760). 

However, further analysis of the initial Swift/UVOT imagery revealed a marginally detected OC with m = 21.1. Additional images in various filters taken over the next approximately 2 hours did not show the OC.

		<grb_description>"The BAT light curve for this burst lasted about 50 seconds. It had a multi-peaked structure. The XRT began observing the field 127 seconds after the trigger and found an uncatalogued and fading x-ray source within the BAT error circle. An unfiltered 150 second finder chart image taken with the UVOT starting 130 seconds after the trigger showed no OC.

However, NIR imagery from the 1.3 meter PAIRITEL on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona found a J = 17.7 object within the XRT error circle. The image was of 55 minute duration and began 46 minutes after the burst trigger. Images obtained simultaneously in H and K did not show the object, but no upper limits were quoted in the circular (GCN 10747). Subsequent observations over the next couple of hours showed that the object was indeed fading, confirming it as the GRB afterglow. In addition, the object was detected in H and K as well as J (GCN 10749). Images obtained from the SARA-North 0.9 meter telescope at Kitt Peak, at roughly the same time as the first Mt. Hopkins observations, did not detect the object to either R > 19.5 or I > 19 (GCN 10748). Using the 40 inch (1 meter) Nickel telescope at Lick Observatory near San Jose, California, observers were able to detect the afterglow in R at 21.39 +/- 0.25 magnitude. The Lick observers argue that the faint R magnitude (as compared to the H and K values) suggests an R-band dropout, and thus a high redshift for the GRB, somewhere between 4.6 &lt; z &lt; 6.0 (GCN 10750). 

This conclusion was confirmed by a spectrum obtained using the 8 meter Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. The spectrum showed a damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system near 7000 angstroms (z ~4.8). In addition, absorption was detected from O I 1302, Si II 1304, C II 1334, C II* 1335, Si IV 1393, 1402, Si II 1526 and C IV 1548, 1550, all at a common redshift of z = 4.772. The spectrum also shows Lyman-alpha forest absorption blueward of the DLA system near 7000 angstroms (GCN 10752)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was an image trigger, so the BAT light curve showed nothing. The XRT began observing the GRB 146 seconds after the trigger, finding a fading, uncatalogued x-ray source. The UVOT also imaged the field, but the initial unfiltered finder chart showed nothing to a limit of about mag 18. However, further analysis of the image showed an object with m = 18.87 in the initial image. A u image started at T+310 seconds showed the object to be at u = 19.25, and then another unfiltered image started at T+846 showed that the object had faded to m = 20.7 (GCN 10730).

Initial reports from the ROTSE-IIa telescope in Australia contained only upper limits on the brightness: m > 16.5 at 158 seconds after the burst (GCN 10729). However, observers using the GROND multi-band imager on the larger aparture 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla in Chile did detect the afterglow. Their observations are listed in the table below (GCN 10734):

g' = 22.0 +- 0.1 mag
r' = 21.8 +- 0.1 mag
i' = 21.5 +- 0.1 mag
z' = 21.7 +- 0.2 mag
J > 21.4
H > 20.8
K > 20.1

The burst was also seen in the Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM) aboard Suzaku. The WAM showed a multi-peaked light curve lasting about 103 seconds (GCN 10735). "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"The BAT light curve for this burst had two peaks, one starting at the trigger time and lasting 8 seconds, and the other beginning 38 seconds after the trigger and lasting about 6 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and started observing with the XRT about 79 seconds after the trigger. A bright, fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was found. No OC was found in an unfiltered UVOT image taken shortly after the XRT image. The  limiting magnitude was 19.6.

From the ground, and optical afterglow was reported from the VLT/X-shooter in Chile. The image, taken in R approximately 4 hours after the burst, showed two sources within the XRT error circle. One of the sources is seen in the DSS, the other, with a magnitude of R = 20.55 +/- 0.2, is not. A second epoch image taken nearly an hour after the first shows that the second object faded by 0.17 +/- 0.8 mag in the interval, suggesting that it is the GRB afterglow (GCN 100425A). Spectra were also obtained using the same telescope and instrument. The spectra cover wavelengths from 3000 to 25,000 angstroms. Absorption lines of MgII and FeII were seen at a common redshift of z = 1.755 (GCN 10684). 

The object was also observed with the GROND multi-band imager on the ESO 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla. The following magnitudes were measured 2.4 hours after the trigger (GCN 10683):

g = 21.5 +- 0.2
r = 21.0 +- 0.1

Ground-based observations from the NOT/ALFOSC were made in R, I and z about 6 to 7 hours after the trigger. No OC was detected to R > 22.5. Observations were hampered by the 85% full moon (GCN 10671). Limits of z > 23.2 were obtained using the William Herschel Telescope approximately 9 hours after the burst (GCN 10672). Many other observatories reported non-detections, but then Gemini-North observers using the NIR imager/spectrometer reported a possible afterglow with K = 19,9, J = 22.1. The observations were made approximately 14 hours after the burst. This is the only object visible within the XRT error circle (GCN 10682).

A bright, fading x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. Additionally, the UVOT found a possible afterglow candidate with m = 20.7 +/- 0.3 (unfiltered). 

From the ground, the GROND multiband imager on the 2.2 meter ESO telescope at La Silla detected a fading point source within the XRT/UVOT error circles. The source was seen in all bands. Preliminary magnitudes are as follows (GCN 10418):

g' = 19.2 +- 0.1 
r' = 18.8 +- 0.1
i' = 18.4 +- 0.1
z' = 18.1 +- 0.1
J  = 17.7 +- 0.1

Additional observatories on the ground were able to confirm these results. In addition. spectra were taken using the VLT/X-shooter on Paranal in Chile. Lines from FeII, MgII, MgI, MnII, Ca H&amp;K were seen in absorption, and [OII] was seen in emission, all at a common redshift of z = 0.6235 (GCN 10620). The spectrum was also measured using the Gemini North 8 meter  telescope and GMOS spectrograph in Hawaii. The Gemini results confirm those from VLT (GCN 10624).

This burst occurred 70 degrees off the LAT bore sight, and an automatic repointing of the telescope was triggered. The LAT detected emission from the GRB source for 300 seconds following the GBM trigger, with 20 photons more energetic than 100 MeV detected. The most energetic photon from the source was 4 GeV (40 seconds after the trigger, GCN 10594). 

This field was observed by the Swift/XRT beginning about 48 hours after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was detected in 1.4 kiloseconds of observations. In these initial observations it was not possible to tell if the source was fading (GCN 10601). The Swift/UVOT also imaged the field. Observations were obtained 40.4 hours after the trigger and 53.2 hours after. There was some evidence for fading over that period:

Filter    T_start (hr)   Exp(s)     Mag     Err
White      40.38          765      20.54 +/- 0.10
White      53.20         3531      20.86 +/- 0.06


The Gemini North telescope (Hawaii) was able to obtain spectroscopy on the object on April 17.26, about 2.5 days after the burst. They detect an i’=20.37 +/- 0.03 object. Spectra in the range 4000 to 8000 angstroms show metal absorption line features from FeII 2374; FeII 2383; FeII 2587; MnII 2594; FeII 2600; MgII 2796, 2803, MgI 2853 all at z = 1.368 (GCN 10606).

Ground-based observers also failed to detect any optical candidate.Observers at the Xinlong TNT telescope observed the field beginning about 10.5 minutes after the burst. No OC was found to fainter than about R ~ 20.5 (GCN 10583). At the 0.9 meter SARA telescope at Kitt Peak in Arizona, images collected 13.4 hours after the burst did not reveal any OC to a limiting magnitude of I ~ 19 (GCN 10587). Similar limits were found by the 2 meter aperture Faulkes Telescope - South in R and I. The images were started 231 seconds after the trigger (GCN 10589).

		<grb_description>This is Swifts 500th GRB detection! It was not automatically followed up because the satellite was just undertaking a pre-planned slew when the burst went off. However, ground analysis did show a significant peak, building for approximately 12 seconds, then tailing off. The slew occurred at T ! 18 seconds. Target Of Opportunity observations were made and the results of those are pending.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was found in ground analysis of BAT data. It did not have high enough significance for an automatic trigger, but the ground analysis did uncover a significant source. The burst was also detected by the Fermi GBM. Target of Opportunity observations were made by Swift with the XRT and UVOT. These observations did not start until about 36 hours after the trigger. Neither instrument was able to detect any source (GCN 10569 and 10570).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst, which lasted about 1.5 seconds, had a single peak. It was located very close to the galactic plane, making it possible that it was the result of a galactic source like a neutron star or x-ray binary. However, the burst spectrum, which is best fit by a simple power law, suggests a cosmological origin. No onboard source was detected, so no automated XRT/UVOT observations were performed.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was an image trigger, and it is possible that the burst has a low level peak about 100 seconds long. The satellite slewed immediately to the burst, with the XRT detecting a bright, uncatalogued xray source. The XRT data collection started 138 seconds after the trigger. The UVOT also imaged the field, but in a 150 second finder chart starting 148 seconds after the trigger, no OC is found. However, part of the UVOT data was not transmitted to the ground, so the overlap between the UVOT and XRT is uncertain, as the precise error circle for the XRT. 

Ground-based observations from GROND/2.2 meter ESO telescope, Gemini/GMOS and VLT/X-shooter all detect a faint DSS galaxy (redshift z = 0.054, GCN 10512) within the XRT error circle. The galaxy contains two compact sources, but neither seems to be fading, and they are likely to be bright areas of the galaxy in any case (e.g., H II regions, see GCN 10513, 10514 and 10516). Gemini observers report seeing a bright object close to the galaxy core, but it is not clear if the source is related to the GRB (GCN 10524). Detailed analysis of the xray data from the XRT puts the most likely redshift for this burst at 0.014 &lt; z &lt; 0.28, which is consistent with the burst being associated with the galaxy reported earlier (GCN 10517)."

Observers using the VLT in Chile observed the OC on 23 March and report the emergence of a possible supernova spectrum from the source (GCN 10543).</grb_description>

In images taken 78 seconds after the trigger, the XRT found an uncatalogued xray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT, beginning 81 seconds after the trigger, did not detect any OC in a 150 second unfiltered exposure. The limiting magnitude was about m = 19.6. 

Imaging from the BOOTES-3 0.6 meter telescope in Blenheim, New Zealand, did not find any OC down to a limiting magnitude of m = 18.5. The observations started 49 seconds after the trigger and continued for ~40 seconds (GCN 10497). Observers using the GROND multiobject imager fared better. Their images started 15.8 hours after the trigger, and using the multiband camera mounted on the ESO 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla, they found a faint object, with g’=23.7 +/- 0.1, r’=24.4 +/- 0.1. They report only upper limits in i’ and z’. The source was not present in catalogs and was placed right at the edge of the XRT error circle.

		<grb_description>"The BAT light curve for this burst had a multi-peaked structure and a duration of about 5 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began observations with the XRT and UVOT. At 64 seconds the XRT began observing the field and detected a fading, uncatalogued xray source. 2 seconds later the UVOT started a 150 second unfiltered finder chart exposure and also detected a source at the GRB position. The preliminary UVOT magnitude was m = 18.36. 

From the ground this afterglow was detected by the GROND multiband imager in Chile, at magnitudes g’ = 19.2 +/- 0.1, r’ = 18.9 +/- 0.1 (GROND zero point magnitudes, uncorrected for extinction). The images were made beginning 16 minutes after the trigger (GCN 10493). The afterglow was also observed from the PROMPT telescopes on Cerro Tololo. In images taken 32 seconds after the trigger using four of the PROMPT telescopes, the OC was seen in all filters. It had a magnitude of I = 15.61 +0.16 / -0.14 at T0+32. From T0+32 seconds to T0+2.1 minutes the OC faded with a power law index of about -1.0. From 2.1 minutes to 35 minutes it faded more slowly, with an index of about -0.3. From 35 to 41 minutes the OC re-brightened, with a power law index of +5.4. It then faded with an index of -0.6 until T0+49 minutes, then more rapidly with an index -1.7 to T0+95 minutes, at which point it had a magnitude of R = 19.51 + 0.33 / - 0.26 (GCN 10494) 

In addition to the reported photometry, a spectrum was obtained from the VLT and X-shooter spectrograph. The spectra were obtained beginning 40 minutes after the trigger and in a set of four 600 second exposures. The wavelength ranged covered is 3200 to 24000 angstroms. Absorption features from Fe II (1608), Al II (1670), Al III (1854), Fe II (2344), Fe II (2374), Fe II (2382), Mg II (2796, 2803) and Mg I (2852) were seen, all with redshift z = 1.180. The wavelength solution is preliminary for these data, so the redshifts might change under further analysis."</grb_description>

The XRT began observing the field 125 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, fading, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT made a 150 second unfiltered exposure beginning 132 seconds after the trigger, but no OC was seen.

From the ground, the field was observed only 2.7 minutes after the trigger from the 40 cm Dolomiti Astronomical Observatory using the PROMPT automation system. In a series of stacked exposures with mean time from the trigger of 73.3 minutes, no OC is detected to R > 20.3 (GCN 10459). 

A series of observations from the Lulin 1 meter telescope in Taiwan showed a marginal detection in R (~21) 16 minutes after the burst. The object was clearly detected at I = 19.9 44 minutes after the burst, but then morning twilight interrupted the observations (GCN 10461). Additional optical observations taken from Russia with the MASTER robotic telescope detected an object at m = 16.9 at T+139 seconds. The object had faded to m = 18.5 in stacked images obtained from 139s to 4046 s (GCN 10463). The object was not detected in a set of observations with the 60 cm robotic telescope in Crni Vrh, Slovenia. These images were begun 194 seconds after the trigger in moonlit conditions. The first has a limiting magnitude of R > 18.3, while a series of summed images totaling 1200 seconds goes a bit deeper to R > 19.6 (GCN 10464). 

Observations using the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii found a source with i’ = 22.01 +/- 0.05 in a 300 second image taken about 11.5 hours after the trigger. A spectrum was also obtained, but no features were reported (GCN 10466). Subsequent spectral of the spectrum did reveal a sharp rise in continuum redward of 7100 angstroms. In addition, there are narrow absorption features consistent with NV, Si II, Si II* and C II, all at a redshift of z = 4.813. This is consistent with an interpretation of the continuum rise at 7100 angstroms as being due to the Lyman limit (GCN 10466).

		<grb_description>" Swift slewed immediately to this burst, which as an image trigger had no interesting light curve features. Later analysis of downlinked BAT data showed a triangular shaped light curve beginning around T-10 seconds, peaking about 40 seconds later, and ending near T+50 seconds. A fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. The XRT observations were begun 178 seconds after the trigger. No source was found inside the XRT error circle in near-simultaneous images obtained with the UVOT. However, an uncatalogued source was found 1.7 arcseconds outside of the XRT error circle. The object had magnitudes m = 20.70 +/- 0.34 and u  =  21.00 +/- 0.56. It was not clear if this source was associated with the GRB (GCN 10432).
Further observations and analysis (GCN 10436) showed that the source was fading, indicating that it was indeed the optical afterglow of the GRB, though superimposed on a possible host galaxy (GCN 10433).

The GROND multiband imager was used to obtain data on the GRB field simultaneously in g’, r’, i’. z’, and JHK. The imager was mounted on the 2.2 meter MPI/ESO telescope at La Silla, Chile. The images were obtained 8.7 hours after the GRB trigger. The OC is detected, as is the possible host galaxy. However, the OC is detected only in r’ and redward; no g’ object is detected. This spectral energy distribution suggests a redshift around z = 4.5 (GCN 10439).

The spectra of the GRB and possibly associated galaxy were obtained using the VLT+X-shooter spectrograph. No flux is seen from the OC blueward of ~5310 angstrom, and there is another spectral break around 7060 angstrom, indicative of the Lyman break and onset of Lyman-alpha forest at a common redshift of z = 4.8. The adjacent galaxy has a redshift of only z = 0.25, and so is not associated with the GRB (GCN 10441). Additional spectral data obtained at the Gemini South telescope in Chile were roughly consistent with, though somewhat lower than, the above redshift values from the VLT. This was true for both the OC and the nearby galaxy (GCN 10443)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a FRED-like structure and a duration of about 30 seconds. The XRT began observing about 150 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, uncatalogued source. The UVOT also imaged the field, beginning 157 seconds after the trigger. In a 77 second unfiltered image, no OC is detected to a limiting magnitude of 20.5 (3-sigma).  

Ground-based imaging was done using the NOT, however, because of poor weather conditions only a single 5 minute exposure was made in R. The exposure was started about 19 minutes after the trigger. An object with R ! 21.5 was detected just outside the XRT error  circle, about 8 arcseconds from the x-ray position. The object is elongated and is not visible in DSS plates. An additional very faint image is reported inside the XRT error circle, with a magnitude of R ! 22.2, near the detection limit of the image (GCN 10413).

Additional ground-based images were obtained using the 1.3 meter PERITAL on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona beginning about 4 hours after the trigger. Images in J, H and Ks failed to detect any afterglow within the XRT error position. Nor was any object detected at the NOT positions reported (above). Limiting magnitudes in the filters were

4.44        2387    Ks      > 17.1

The Gemini North telescope also observed the field. They do detect the NOT-reported image at the edge of the XRT error circle in a 2 minute r-band image. The subsequently obtained a spectrum of the object, detecting [OII]3727, H-beta and [OIII]5007 at a common redshift of z = 0.604. It is not clear that this object is related to the GRB (GCN 10422).

Imaging was also done using the 14 inch Goddard Robotic Telescope beginning 56 minutes after the trigger. In 59 R images each of 60 second exposure, no OC is detected, either in the individual images or when they are combined (GCN 10426)."</grb_description>

The XRT began observing the field about 73 seconds after the trigger, detecting an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT observed the field beginning 76 after the trigger, but no credible optical afterglow is reported.

Observations from the SARA telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona were started approximately 4 hours after the trigger. No OC was detected in the 20 minutes of stacked images. The limiting magnitude was R > 20 (based on USNO star comparisons, GCN 10415).

Additional ground-based images taken with the 14-inch Goddard Robotic Telescope in Maryland did not find any OC. The images were begun about 1.2 hours after the burst and continued for about an hour in the R filter. The limiting magnitude is estimated as R > 17.5 (GCN 10435)."</grb_description>

The limiting magnitude was U > 19.2. 


Ground-based observations from the NOT showed a faint object, R = 20.3, near the center of the XRT error circle approximately 6 hours after the GRB trigger. No corresponding object is evident in the DSS plate of the region (GCN 10402). The object was also seen in images from the Mt. Lemmon 1 meter telescope in Arizona.

		<grb_description>"This was a short burst, with a single peak of 0.3 second duration. The satellite slewed immediately to the burst, with the XRT beginning observations 75 seconds after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also observed the field, beginning 78 seconds after the trigger, but there was no OC evident in the 150 second unfiltered finder chart images. 

In the initial hours after the burst, no OC was reported, despite attempts using GROND at La Silla, with upper limits  (GCN 10383)

g' > 22.8,
r' > 23.0,
i' > 22.4,
z' > 22.2,
J > 21.0,
H > 20.6
K > 20.3

As well as the 0.6 meter TELMA robotic telescope, I > 21 (GCN 10384). Images were also made in the first minute after the burst, but with a much smaller aperture, from the University  of Miyazaki (RIMOTS, 30 cm). These unfiltered images had limiting magnitudes

---------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, a candidate OC was detected using the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma in observations made approximately 7 hours after the trigger. The source was located just outside the XRT error circle and was detected in both I and z (magnitudes are not reported! GCN 10386). 

Spectroscopy was obtained for the possible host galaxy (GCN 377) using the Keck-I + LRIS. A very red continuum is evident, as are emission lines of H-alpha and [NII] at z = 0.41. No other lines are visible, and no trace is seen at the position of the GRB. If this galaxy is indeed the host, then the projected distance to the GRB at the measured redshift is 35 kiloparsecs (GCN 10389)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a duration of approximately 30 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and started observing with the XRT 175 seconds after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also observed the field, but in 150 second unfiltered images begun 177 seconds after the trigger, no OC was found. 

Ground based  observers searched for an afterglow using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). In R and I imaging done 39 and 59 minutes after the trigger, respectively, there was no OC found. Limits were R > 23.7 and I > 23.2 (GCN 10362). Additional ground based images from LOTIS on Kitt Peak also failed to find an afterglow brighter than V = 18 in the first ~10 minutes after the burst (GCN 10364).  Gemini South also failed to detect any afterglow (GCN 10365), but Gemini North detected a point source in K-band images taken 2.6 hours after the trigger. The magnitude of the source was K ~ 20.2. The source also showed marginal detections in J and H bands (GCN 10366). Subsequent analysis of the Gemini N photometry produced

J_AB > 23.37 mag (1-sigma UL)
H_AB     = 23:54 +- 0.22 mag
K_AB     = 21.91 +- 0.20 mag

Which implies 11 &lt;~  z &lt; ~ 13.5 if the extremely red K - H colors are assumed caused by Lyman-alpha absorption in the H bandpass. However, other possibilities are not ruled out, including host extinction, unusual intrinsic colors for the afterglow or large contribution to the light by the host galaxy (GCN 10374)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst was a single spike lasting 0.4 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the field of view and began observing with the XRT 80 seconds after the trigger. A bright, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also imaged the region, but no OC was obvious.

Observers using the Nordic Optical Telescope at La Silla began observing the field approximately 20 minutes after the trigger. A faint object, only marginally detected, was seen in a 900 second R-band image. The object was not seen in a set of co-added K-band images (GCN 10337). However, this source seemed to coincide with archival images taken at the CFHT (GCN 10339), indicating that it could not be the afterglow of the GRB. The same archival sources, and no others, were detected by imaging from the Magellan/Baade 6.5 meter telescope taken 3.9 hours after the burst trigger (GCN 10340). Subsequent analysis of the XRT data excluded all but one of the four objects from the XRT error circle; the faint object first reported by NOT was one of the excluded objects (GCN 10343).

The Gemini North telescope was used to obtain further images and spectra of the objects in the field. One object was shown to be an M dwarf star by its spectrum, while two other objects showed no spectral features (GCN 10346). Deep images showed that one of these remaining objects faded by 0.23 +/- 0.06 magnitudes over 25 hours, suggesting that it might host the GRB. Image subtraction reveals an object offset from the center of the possible host (GCN 10349)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had two separate peaks separated by more than 60 seconds. There was essentially no emission evident between the peaks. The total duration of the burst was approximately 110 seconds. Both peaks were best fit with a power law plus high energy cutoff for the spectra. The first peak had an index of -0.92 +/- 0.15 and Epeak = 240 +60/-40 keV. The second peak had an index of -1.02 +/- 0.017 and Epeak = 1240 +/- 90 keV. The burst was also seen by the LAT, which saw an increase in the flux coincident with the second peak. Most of the energy was detected below 100 MeV (GCN 10333).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst was detected on the ground during data collected during a pre-planned slew of the satellite. It was found as part of the BAT Slew Survey. The burst had a FRED peak with a duration of about 3 seconds. No flux was detected above 100 keV. The source was observed as a Target Of Opportunity starting about 11 hours after the trigger. A single x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle in 2.5 kiloseconds of XRT observations (GCN 10326). UVOT also made observations simultaneously with the XRT, but no optical source was found to coincide with the XRT source (GCN 10327).

The 0.9 meter SARA telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona made a 1200 second observation of the field beginning 15 hours and 20 minutes after the burst. A faint object, R ~ 22, was found within the XRT error circle. There is no corresponding object in the SDSS, which goes deeper than the SARA image, thus it is possible that this source is the GRB afterglow (GCN 10328). Additional observations of the field were taken using the 2.56 meter NOT at La Silla. The images have a limiting magnitude of i’=24.0, and a single extended object is seen within the XRT error circle (GCN10331). This extended object matches the position of the object reported by SARA (GCN 10332). Observations of this object using the Gemini North telescope taken on Jan 16 and 17, respectively, found that it had faded by approximately half a magnitude in both r and g, suggesting that the extended object is the host of the GRB and its afterglow (GCN 10335)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst contained two peaks, one lasting from T0 to T+15, and another stronger peak from T+15 to T+40. There is some overlap in the field with the flaring AGN A0535+262, but the light curves from the two objects are mostly distinguishable. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began observing with the XRT about 72 seconds after the trigger. A bright, fading x-ray source was found. Similarly, the UVOT began imaging the field 79 seconds after the trigger, however, the initial optical images showed no OC to a limiting magnitude of m = 19.6 (3 sigma).

From the ground, the ROTSE-IIIc telescope at Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia began observing the field 26 seconds after the burst, finding an m = 17.4 object within the XRT error circle. The object is not present in the Digitized Sky Survey, 2MASS or MPChecker (GCN 10284). Additional analysis of the UVOT data taken immediately after the trigger confirmed the presence of the source (GCN 10285).

The object was also detected in five of seven bands with the GROND multi-band imager at La Silla, Chile. Magnitudes and upper limits are as follows (GCN 10286):

g' = 22.90 +/- 0.30
r' = 22.27 +/- 0.30

		<grb_description>"Swift slewed immediately to this burst, which showed a double-peaked light curve. The burst lasted about 15 seconds. The afterglow was detected by both the XRT and the UVOT, with the former beginning to observe the field 115 seconds after the trigger, and the latter 4 seconds thereafter. The UVOT initial magnitude estimate is m = 17.9, unfiltered.

On the ground, the ROTSE-IIIb telescope at McDonald Observatory in Texas began observing 30 seconds after the trigger. Their initial imaging showed no OC to a limiting magnitude of m ~ 17.3 (unfiltered, GCN 10254). Observers using the BOOTES-3 robotic telescope in New Zealand do report seeing the afterglow in images begun 45 seconds after the trigger, but they give no magnitude (! -GCN 10255). Observations from the MITSuME 50 centimeter telescope at Akeno, Japan detected the OC in all three bands observed: g’=17.2,+/-0.2 Rc=16.1+/-0.1 and Ic=15.5+/-0.1 (GCN 10260). The OC was also observed by several other ground-based facilities.

A spectrum obtained from the Gemini North telescope was able to provide a redshift of z = 1.063 based on absorption from MgII (2796,2803), Mg I (2583), Fe I (2967), Fe II (2586, 2600) and Mn II (2576, 2594, 2606) in their spectrum covering the range from 4000 to 8400 angstroms (GCN 10263)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"Swift was not able to slew immediately to this burst because of Earth limb constraint. The BAT light curve showed a multipeaked structure and had a duration of about 10 seconds. 

The burst exited constraint and Swift was able to image the field 3219 seconds after the trigger. A magnitude 16.21 object was detected with the UVOT (unfiltered 150 seconds exposure). It was located 40.9 seconds from the center of the BAT error circle (GCN 10193).

This afterglow was also detected from the ground by several observing groups. Using the 2 meter Liverpool Telescope, observations begun 2.35 minutes after the trigger revealed the fading candidate to have a magnitude around R = 15.0 (GCN  10192). The 60 centimeter REM telescope also detected the afterglow in imaging started 90 minutes after the trigger. At that time the OC had H=12.6 +/- 0.15, J = 13.1 +/- 0.23 (GCN 10194). The GROND imager also detected the afterglow, with magnitudes reported below. These were obtained simultaneously in images taken 58 minutes after the trigger:

g = 16.63 +- 0.15
r = 16.53 +- 0.15
i = 16.42 +- 0.15
z = 16.35 +- 0.15
J = 16.40 +- 0.10
H = 16.36 +- 0.14

This burst was quite bright and very slow to decays, so it was seen by numerous ground observers in the hours following the trigger. A set of observations showing this decay was obtained using the TAROT at La Silla (GCN 10200):

-----------------------------------
  Tstart    Tstop  Rmag
  (min)     (min)
-----------------------------------
   69.12 - 82.19  16.4 +/- 0.2
  106.59 - 119.67 16.7 +/- 0.3
  144.33 - 157.41 16.7 +/- 0.3
  182.09 - 222.83 17.0 +/- 0.2
  229.91 - 346.22 17.1 +/- 0.2
  367.71 - 444.61 17.4 +/- 0.2
-----------------------------------


A spectrum of the object was obtained using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. These were two exposures of 90 seconds duration each. The wavelength range of the spectra was 4000 to 8000 angstrom. The spectra were mostly featureless, but two emission lines were seen. They were identified as [OIII] 4959,5007 at a redshift of z = 0.490 (GCN 10202).

Additional followup observations from the NOT taken 22.4347 hours after the trigger show the afterglow at R=18.95 (GCN 10205), but observations taken from TAROT at 1.12 and 1.37 days, respectively, do not show any sign of it to R = 20.0 (GCN 10208),

Radio observations were also made of the field. The first were from LABOCA/APEX in Chile at 870 um. These began 3.48 hours after the trigger and continued for ~3 hours. In an image with an rms of 4.5mJy, no candidate source is detected (GCN 10206). Observations were also made using the VLA in New Mexico, USA. The 8.46 GHz band was used for two sets of observations taken on November 29.22 and 30.21, respectively. No source was detected to 3-sigma limits of 300 uJy. No deeper observations were done due to the presence of a bright double-radio source nearby (GCN 10211)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was extremely unusual. The GBM light curve showed four emission peaks separated by long quiet periods. However, comparison with Konus-Wind data showed that the burst was already occurring when its position rose above the limb of the Earth as seen from Fermi. Using only the GBM data the burst duration was 650 seconds. It’s spectrum was fit by a power-law with exponential cutoff: index = -1.-8 +/- 0.05, Epeak = 101.30 +5.16/-4.52 keV. </grb_description>

This object was also detected as a hard x-ray transient by the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) on the MAXI mission. The position is consistent with the GBM position, though MAXI positions should be improved after the spacecraft completes its commissioning phase (GCN 10188)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst was first noticed by the WAM aboard Suzaku. It was also seen by Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL SPI ACS and the Swift BAT (from which the position has been determined). The BAT saw a weak precursor lasting about 0.12 seconds with the main burst following and lasting about 0.4 seconds. 

Observations taken with the Swift XRT found an x-ray source coincident with a DSS galaxy (GCN 10173). 

From the ground, imaging with the 6.5 meter Magellan telescope at Las Campanas, Chile, found that the DSS galaxy was a face-on spiral. A bright point source was seen in one of the spiral arms (GCN 10174), but subsequent spectroscopy from the Gemini-North telescope found that object to have a spectrum consistent with it being an HII region (GCN 10176). Additional observations from Gemini-South in g’, r’ and I’ in poor seeing conditions did not reveal any point sources within the BAT error circle (GCN 10178), or did additional observations from the Magellan telescope in r (GCN 10183)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The light curve for this burst was symmetrical, with a total duration of about 20 seconds. Swift was not able to slew immediately to this burst because of a sun constraint. And since the constraint will not be lifted in the near future, no XRT/UVOT data will be available for this burst. The burst is only 10 degrees from the Galactic center, so it is not possible to rule out the possibility that the burst was caused by a galactic source


This burst also triggered the Fermi GBM. The GBM light curve showed a broad peak lasting about 40 seconds. The spectrum was fit by a power-law with index -1.13 +/- 0.04 and a high energy cutoff at Epeak = 750 +/- 120 keV.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst showed only a single spike in the BAT light curve. It lasted 0.4 seconds. The XRT began observing the field about 78 seconds after the trigger, finding an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. No OC was found by UVOT in a 250 second U-filter exposure started 296 seconds after the trigger. 

Observations from the GROND imager on the 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla were able to detect an optical afterglow in images taken 19.1 hours after the burst and continuing for 1.8 hours. These observations are listed beow:

g' = 24.5 +/- 0.1
r' = 23.6 +/- 0.1
i' = 23.4 +/- 0.1
z' = 23.3 +/- 0.2
J > 22.2
H > 21.8
K > 21.2

Assuming the g’-r’ color is caused by Lyman alpha absorption allows a photometric redshift of z_p = 3.5 +/- 0.4. Spectroscopy from the VLT/FORS2 taken 21.5 hours after the burst shows a broad absorption at 5700 angstrom. If this is due to Lyman alpha, then the redshift is indeed z = 3.5. However, there is a possible host galaxy at z = 0.44 which could also be responsible for the observed absorption features. Without addition features it is not possible to determine which of these possibilities is correct (GCN 10158)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had two peaks, with the first occurring at T0 and the second, smaller one, at T+40 seconds. The total duration for the burst was about 50 seconds. Observing constraints prevented Swift from slewing until T+50 seconds, so no prompt XRT or UVOT data was obtained.

On the ground, the 2 meter Faulkes Telescope North began observing the BAT field 3.27 minutes after the trigger. An uncatalogued OC was seen with R = 18.1 (GCN 10063).

Observations taken with the Global-rent-a-scope in New Mexico detected an m = 18.2+/-0.4 object at the same position as the Faulkes result. The observations were begun 48 minutes after the trigger, and the detection was made in a 600 second unfiltered exposure (GCN 10064).

The Gemini North telescope observed the OC with the GMOS-N spectrograph beginning ~1:45 after the trigger. The spectrum covered the range from 5925 to 10200 angstrom and showed absorption from Ca II H&amp;K, Mg I (2853), all at a common redshift of z = 1.092 (GCN 10065)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted about 45 seconds. There was an initial bright peak followed by a dimmer one at T+30. The satellite slewed immediately and began observing with the XRT 81 seconds after the trigger. A bright, fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. In addition, the UVOT found an optical counterpart in its initial 150 second white light exposure, begun at T+89 seconds. The estimated magnitude of the OC was m = 15.73.

Ground-based observations from Kislovodsk, Russia also detected the OC. In observations begun 57 minutes after the trigger, a m = 17.5 object was found at the UVOT position. Continuing observations over the subsequent 2.5 hours showed that the source dimmed according to a power-law decay with index alpha = -1.3 (GCN 10052).

Additional observations were obtained using the 1.34 meter telescope at Theuringer Landessternwarte Tuatenberg, Germany. The observations began 4 hours after the burst, and are summarized in the table below (GCN 10076):

Observations from the NOT/ALFOSC showed that the source had dimmed to R ~ 20 by about T+7.5 hours. Low-resolution spectroscopy covering 3500-9100 angstrom was carried out using the telescope. Absorption from FeII (2344, 2374, 2382), Al III (1854, 1862), Mg II (2798) all at z = 1.71 (Mg II 2803 was blended with atmospheric A-band). Flux is detected down to 3800 angstrom, which sets an upper limit of z &lt; 2.13 for the GRB (GCN 10053).


Observations collected using the VLA radio telescope near Socorro, NM have detected the afterglow at 8.46 GHz. Observations were obtained at six different times, with fluxes given below (GCN 10088):

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single FRED-like light curve lasting about 10 seconds. The XRT began observing the field about 61 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright uncatalogued x-ray source. The UVOT also observed the field, finding a bright, m=14.60 (unfiltered) object in a 150 second long image begun 68 seconds post-trigger.

The ROTSE-III telescope on Mt. Gamsberg, Namibia, observed this field about ten minutes after the trigger. An uncatalogued object with m=15.4 was found. The source was rapidly fading, confirming it to the the afterglow of the GRB (GCN 10035).

The multiband GROND imager also obtained images of the OC approximately 4 hours after the trigger. These provided the following magnitudes (GCN 10039):

g'= 19.061 +/- 0.010

Observations from the Magellan Clay Telescope/MagE eschellette spectrograph provided a spectrum with strong absorption features. These include Mg II, Fe II, Mn II, all at a redshift of z = 0.971 (GCN 10038).

Additional spectroscopy was obtained using the VLT/X-shooter. These covered the spectral range from 3000 to 24800 angstroms. Absorption lines were detected from Al II(1670), Al III (1854, 1862), FeII (2260, 2344, 2374, 2382, 2586, 2600), Mn II (2576, 2594, 2606), Mg II (2797, 2803), Mg I (2852) and Ca II(3394, 3969), all at a redshift of z = 0.971, confirming the Magellan result, above. They also report tentative detection of [OII], [OIII] and H-alpha in emission (presumably from the host galaxy) at the same redshift (GCN 10042)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a lot of structure in its light curve. Its duration was about 10 seconds. 

Swift began observing the burst about twelve hours after the trigger. A single uncatalogued x-ray source was detected by the XRT within the SuperAGILE error box. It was not clear from these observations if this source was fading (GCN 10006). Observations were carried out with the UVOT simultaneous to the XRT observations. No optical candidate was found to limiting magnitude wh > 21.36 (GCN 10007).

The burst was also detected by RXTE. Two flares were seen, the first coincided with the SuperAGILE trigger, the other occurred 2 seconds later. There was also evidence for a weaker flare 5 seconds after the trigger (GCN 10014).

Observers using the GROND multi-band imager and the ESO 2.5 meter telescope at La Silla began observing the field about 21 hours after the burst. They found a single faint source with r’ = 22.2 within the XRT error circle. Atmospheric conditions prevented the detection of this source in other bands (GCN 10008)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had multiple peaks. It lasted approximately 21 seconds. The spectrum was fit by a Band function with alpha = -1.13 +/- 0.01, beta = -2.64 +/- 0.24 and Epeak = 486.2 +/- 23.6 keV.

The burst was bright enough to cause a Fermi spacecraft repointing maneuver, and 5 hours of pointed observations were made. The LAT showed a significant increase in emission after the GBM trigger (GCN 9985). 

Observations with the Swift XRT were begun 15.5 hours after the Fermi/GBM trigger. A total of 2.5 kiloseconds were observed, revealing an uncatalogued x-ray source 6.85 arcminutes from the LAT position (GCN 9986). Subsequent observations taken up to 168 kiloseconds after the trigger showed that this source was fading, and thus was the GRB afterglow (GCN 9991).

The Swift UVOT observed the source contemporaneously with the XRT. In the initial set of observations a faint, fading source was found inside the XRT error circle. The observations were taken in the uvw2 filter, and the object’s magnitude was 21.02 +/- 0.27. No extinction correction has been applied (GCN 9987).

The afterglow was also seen by observers using the William Herschel Telescope and ACAM. In 60 and 250 second exposures started 1.69 days after the trigger, an r = 21.33 _/- 0.11 object was detected. A spectrum was also taken, but only faint continuum emission was seen. No strong or absorption lines were present, but the continuum seen at 4000A implies an upper limit of z = 2.3 for the redshift (GCN 9995)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was a short burst, lasting only about 1.5 seconds. It had a single peak. An observing constraint prevented the satellite from slewing to the burst for 33 minutes, so no prompt XRT/UVOT data was obtained. The UVOT began observing the field beginning 2141 seconds (~70 minutes) after the trigger. In a 150 second finder chart exposure (unfiltered) there is an afterglow candidate with m = 19.10 +/- 0.15 (GCN 9946). 

Images were also obtained from the 1 meter Zadko telescope which showed a fading source within the XRT error circle 110 minutes after the trigger. Magnitudes were measured as follows GCN 9956):

The VLT/FORS2 was used to obtain a spectrum of the OC starting 16.5 hours after the trigger. At that time the OC had a magnitude of R = 21.7. The spectrum shows absorption from Mg II and Fe II at z = 1.37. No evidence was seen for higher redshift systems, nor for Lyman-alpha, indicating that this is indeed the redshift of the GRB (GCN 9958). "</grb_description>

A bright, fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle.

This burst was also detected by the Gas Slit Camera aboard the MAXI mission aboard the ISS. A bright x-ray source was seen to turn on at 21:55:31 and stay on until 21:55:55. The source position was consistent with the GRB position reported from Swift. Note that the start time of the x-rays was 17 seconds before the trigger, but roughly consistent with the refined BAT analysis (GCN 9939) reported later (GCN 9943). 

Observers using NOT report observations of the field in R and I beginning about 5 hours after the trigger. No object is seen within the XRT error circle to a magnitude limit of R ~ 23 (GCN 9941). At the VLT in Chile, observers  reported finding a faint, diffuse object within the XRT error circle. The object had a magnitude of R = 23 and was coincident with a faint nebulosity in the NOT images (GCN 9944). Using the FORS2 spectrograph the VLT observers obtained a redshift based upon an emission line taken to be O II 372,  and absorption from Mg II, Fe II and Al III, all at z = 1.24. It was not clear if the object measured was the OC itself or some combination of the GRB afterglow and host galaxy (GCN 9947). "</grb_description>

A redshift was obtained for this afterglow from the VLT/X-shooter. These observations, which where done a part of the science verification for the new X-shooter single object spectrograph, were begun 22 hours after the burst. The afterglow had R = 17.9 at that time, and four 1800 second exposures were taken to produce the spectra. The final spectrum contained many absorption features, including CIV 1548 and 1550, Si II 1304 and 1526, Si II* 1533, FeII 1608, MgII 2798 and 2803 and unspecified others. There was also a broad absorption near 3780 which was interpreted as damped Lyman-alpha. These lines are all seen at a common redshift of z = 2.1062. The wavelength solution for these lines is based on archival calibration data, so minor corrections might be needed (GCN 9942).

The Swift XRT began observing the field 12.4 hours after the trigger. A fading source was found in 5ks of exposures (GCN 9914). 

From the ground, the 0.9 meter SARA telescope at Kitt Peak observed the field starting ~12.3 hours after the burst. Observations continued for about half an hour. In 21 minutes of stacked exposures a marginal source was detected within the XRT error circle. The magnitude is R ~ 20.5 +/- 0.3 (compared to USNO B1.0 field stars).

An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also imaged the field, but found no creditable optical counterpart to the GRB.  The x-ray afterglow had disappeared in XRT observations taken 13 and 17 days later, respectively. Thus the XRT source reported initially was likely the afterglow of the GRB (GCN 9911).

Optical limits were obtained from the ground using 0.4 meter telescope at Hankasalmi Observatory. In a series of 57 stacked images of 1  minute duration each, no OC is seen to a limit of 21.6 (unfiltered). USNO-A2.0 stars were used for magnitude comparison, and the midpoint of the exposure series occurred on Sept 12 19:33 UT (GCN 9907)."</grb_description>

It found an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle.  The UVOT did not find any OC in unfiltered exposures started 137 seconds after the trigger.

Observations from La Silla using the REM 60 cm telescope started 108 seconds after the trigger. No OC was found in exposures in VRIJHK. The field is quite close to the Galactic center, and so it is quite strongly reddened (and extincted). These observations did reveal an H=11.95 2MASS star at the XRT position (GCN 9892). 

The field was also observed using the 2.2 meter ESO telescope and GROND multiband imager. The initial observations were begun 4 minutes after the trigger. A second set of observations was obtained 24 hours later. Subtracting the two epochs reveals a faint, fading object, 1.1” south/east of the 2MASS object mentioned in GCN 9892. It’s magnitude was r’ ~ 22.2 6.5 minutes after the trigger, and it was seen in all GROND filters except g’. Due to the large Galactic extinction (E(B-V = 1.76) it is not possible to deduce any redshift information from the magnitude information (GCN 9901)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single bright pulse lasting about 21 seconds. It was also independently detected by the INTEGRAL SPI-ACS. The  spectrum was fit by a Band function with alpha =-0.696 +/- 0.012, beta = -3.85 +0.21/-0.31 and Epeak = 775 +/- 11 keV. The burst was also seen in the LAT (GCN 9867).

Ongoing analysis with the Fermi GBM and LAT showed that the burst was detected in the LAT for at least 300 seconds. 

The Swift satellite began TOO observations 12.5 hours after the GBM trigger. It found an uncatalogued x-ray source within the GBM error circle (GCN 9868). Analysis of the observations, taken over ~4.5 hours, confirms that the object was fading, and thus was likely the GRB afterglow (GCN 9876).

Swift UVOT observations were done simultaneously to the XRT ones, and a faint (m = 20.41 +/- 0.2) object was found within the XRT error circle. Though the object is not visible in the DSS image of the field, there is another faint object nearby, so it was not possible to make a positive identification between the two (GCN 9869).

Observations taken with the 1 meter Nickel telescope at Lick Observatory were consistent with the source found by the UVOT, but no fading was evident, so the identification of the source with the GRB was still uncertain (GCN 9870).

A spectrum obtained using the Gemini North telescope showed metal absorption from MgII[2796,2803], MgI[2853],MnII[2606], FeII[2600], MnII[2594], FeII[2586], FeII[2260], SiII[1808], SiII*[1816], all at a redshift of z = 1.822 (GCN 9873).  

This field was observed on September 03.94 from the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico. The GRB was detected at 8.46 GHz (GCN 9889)."</grb_description>

The burst was so bright that Fermi repositioned to do a pointed observation beginning 3100 seconds after the trigger. Earth constraint prevented an earlier pointed observation.

This burst was also detected by the RT-2 Experiment (both detectors RT-2/S and RT-2/G) aboard CORONAS-PHOTON. A precursor followed by single peak at T0+34 seconds was seen, consistent with the behavior seen by Fermi. The burst width was seen to diminish with increasing energy (GCN 9833)."</grb_description>

The Swift-XRT observed the field starting 3 hours after the trigger until nearly 5 hours after, obtaining a total of 30 minutes of data on-target. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found in the INTEGRAL error circle. This source was 1.3 arcseconds from the USNO-B1 source, which has magnitudes I = 18.5, R = 20.0 and B = 20.8. The x-ray source showed a rapid rise in brightness followed by dimming. Given this light curve it is not certain that the observed source is the GRB afterglow. Additional observations are planned for 8/17 (GCN 9819). The UVOT also observed the field, but no optical counterpart was seen to m > 21.3."</grb_description>

In addition, Earth observing constraint prevented the spacecraft from slewing automatically. The light curve shows a single weak peak, lasting 0.6 +/- 0.3 seconds. The spectrum was best fit by a simple power law of index 0.90 +/- 0.47.</grb_description>

The XRT started observing the field 159 seconds after the trigger; a bright, fading, uncatalogued  x-ray source was found. The UVOT also observed the field, but in the 150 second unfiltered image taken 169 seconds after the trigger, no OC was found.

From the ground, observers using the GROND multiband imager on the 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla began observing the field 7 minutes after the trigger. They found a single point source within the XRt error circle with g’ = 21.62 +/- 0.04 and r’ = 21.21 +/- 0.04. Only faint upper limits are reported for the other filters (GCN 9794).

A spectrum was obtained using the FORS2 spectrograph at the VLT on Paranal in Chile. The spectrum was taken 70 minutes after the burst trigger. The continuum was seen down to at least 3900 Angstrom, and no Lyman-alpha was detected. This places an upper limit of z &lt; 2.2 on the burst. Weak absorption from Mg II and Ca II at z = 0.696 place a lower limit on the redshift. While the Mg and Ca absorption could be intrinsic to the burst itself, it could also be caused by intervening material (GCN 9797)."</grb_description>

From the ground, observers using the Palomar 60 inch telescope imaged the field in r’, I’ and z’ beginning about 2 minutes after the trigger. A fading point source was found within the the BAT error circle. The magnitude (converted to I-band) is around I = 18 (GCN 9783). Imaging was also done using the Calar Alto 1.23 meter telescope, beginning approximately 4.5 minutes after the trigger. It showed an I ~17 object coinciding with the XRT source, though not present in the DSS plate of the region (GCN 9782).

The burst also triggered the Fermi GBM, which saw two separate pulses lasting about 9 seconds total. The spectrum was fit by a power law with high energy cutoff. The power law index was -1.43 +/- 0.08 and the cutoff energy was Epeak = 161 +/- 26 keV (GCN 9792)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted approximately ten seconds. It showed only a single weak peak. The satellite slewed immediately to the burst and started XRT observations 104 seconds after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. Beginning 107 second post trigger the UVOT also imaged the field. A possible OC was found, with an unfiltered magnitude of m = 19.9. The OC position did not include the XRT position in this initial sub-image.

From the ground, observers using the Nordic Optical Telescope confirmed the UVOT candidate as the afterglow. In images obtained 4.3 hours after the burst, they find an I~19.1, R~20.3 object corresponding to the UVOT object but not present in SDSS frames of the same field, strongly suggesting that this is indeed the GRB afterglow (GCN 9755)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was an image trigger and so the BAT TDRSS does not show a light curve. The XRT began observing the field 154 seconds after the trigger. A bright, fading uncatalogued source was found. The UVOT also observed the field, starting 163 seconds after the trigger, but no OC was found in the initial reductions. The limiting magnitude (3-sigma) was approximately 19.2. Subsequent imaging and analysis with the UVOT failed to find any object consistent with the position of the XRT source to a magnitude fainter than 21.1 in exposures that continued  to ~12 minutes after the trigger (GCN 9751).

Ground-based observers faired no better than Swift in finding an OC. Early observations from the ground obtained limits consistent with those from the UVOT. The deepest limits were set by the Liverpool Telescope, though their observations did not start until 8 hours after the burst. They found no OC to R > 22.1 and I > 22.0 (GCN 9753).

An uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also imaged the field, starting 91 seconds after the trigger. No OC was found in the initial data products. 

The robotic 2 meter Liverpool Telescope began observing the GRB field approximately 161 seconds after the trigger. A source not present in the DSS was found in r’ and I’ lying within the XRT error circle. The magnitude of the source is reported as R = 21.3 +/- 0.2, I = 20.2 +/- 0.2 (GCN 9719). Subsequent observations and analysis showed that the object exhibited appreciable variability within the first 100 minutes after the burst. A flare was seen to r’ = 19.4, followed by a plateau and a break, similar to the XRT light curve (GCN 9722). The object was also observed from Calar Alto Observatory using the 1.23 meter telescope. It had I = ~19.4 in exposures taken between 0.45 and 1.45 hours after the burst (GCN 9728)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"The BAT light curve had a small precursor at T-20 seconds, then a single FRED pulse  with rapid variability superimposed. The duration was about 50 seconds. Not prompt UVOT/XRT data were obtained because the satellite could not slew for ~49 minutes. Following the lifting of the Earth-limb constraint, Swift slewed and began observing with the XRT; an uncatalogued was found within the BAT error circle (GCN 9707). No optical counterpart was seen by the UVOT at that time (GCN 9708).

From the ground, observers using the 1 meter SAO RAS telescope in the Caucasus, Russia, found an object in the field that faded over time, as follows (GCN 9709):

   R_mag         exp.(sec)       mid.time
                             (sec after the trigger)

19.55 +/- 0.12    300              6824

A spectrum was obtained using the 6 meter telescope at the same observatory. Lines of Si I (1526.7), CIV (1548.2, 1550.8), Al II (1670.8), Si II (1304.4, 1309.3), Si IV (1393.7, 1402.7), Fe II (1608.4) and Lyman alpha were found, all at a redshift of z = 2.71.

The afterglow was also detected at much earlier times, only 194 seconds after the trigger, by observers using the 0.5 meter telescope at Ondrejov, Czech Republic. It had a magnitude of m ~ 18.3 (GCN 9714). Observers in Slovenia at the Crni Vrh Observatory also obtained photometric data shortly after the burst. Their data are below (GCN 9715):

		<grb_description>"This burst had four major peaks, with the first occurring about 20 seconds before the trigger and continuing for about 100 seconds after the trigger. The satellite slewed immediately to the burst and began observing with the XRT after 68 seconds. A fading, uncatalogued object was found within the BAT error circle. The UVOT began observing 76 seconds after the trigger, but no OC was found in the initial data analysis.

From the ground, many telescopes were used to observe the field in the optical, NIR and radio. The first reported optical limits were from the ROTSE-III telescope, which reported limiting magnitudes in the 16 to 18 range in observations begun 30 seconds after the trigger and continuing for ~6 minutes (GCN 9626). At approximately the same time, the Faulkes North telescope set slightly fainter limits in R and I: R > 19.3, I > 18.3 (GCN 9630). The Subaru telescope in Hawaii was used to image the field, and it detected two sources close to the XRT error circle. One had J = 19.0, K = 18.2 and the other K = 18.6 (not seen in J, GCN 9634). The Palomar 60 inch telescope also observed the field, making marginal detections in z’ and r’, but only in two images out of seven (GCN 9646):

The PARITEL 1.3m telescope on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona was used to obtain images starting ~108 seconds after the trigger. The images, taken in J H and K did not initially show any source to limits consistent with those above (GCN 9628). However, closer inspection of the data did reveal a source in H and K within the XRT error circle. Magnitudes are as follows:

post_burst
t_mid(s) exp(s)  filt  mag
438       374     J     > 17.7 (3 sig)
438       374     H     16.7 +/- 0.2
438       374     Ks    15.3 +/- 0.2

Images taken later in the night did not show this source, suggesting that it was the OC of the GRB (GCN 9635).  Reanalysis of the early Faulkes data also revealed a barely-detected object at the position of the PARITEL source and the second of the two Subaru sources (GCN 9648). 

Observations taken using the 10.3 meter GTC on La Palma failed to detect the afterglow to I’ = 25.5 approximately 41 hours after the trigger (GCN 9655). In observations taken at Westerbork around the same time, no object was seen at the OC position (GCN 9654), nor did VLA observations detect the OC (GCN 9657)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"Swift did not slew to this burst due to Sun constraint. The field will not be available until early October, and so no XRT/UVOT data will be available for this burst. The BAT light curve showed a single peak lasting approximately 20 seconds.  The burst also triggered in the Fermi/GBM. The GBM spectrum was fit by a power law with exponential cutoff. The power law index was -1.29 +0.41/-0.34 and the cutoff energy was Epeak = 47.5 +12.0/-0.2 keV.

Ground-based observers were not able to find any optical counterpart. The ROTSE-III telescope was used to get limits within the first ~ 1 minute after the burst; limiting magnitudes were in the 15 to 17 range in images taken from 1 to 6 minutes after the trigger (GCN 9622). The RAPTOR telescope had similar results in data taken essentially simultaneously with that of ROTSE-III (GCN 9624)."</grb_description>

The field was observed by Swift using the XRT about an hour after the burst (at 14:30:13), and a faint x-ray source was detected. However, because of the long time delay it was not possible to determine if any source was fading in the initial observations (GGN 9573). However, subsequent analysis did show that the source had faded, suggesting that it was the afterglow of the GRB (GCN 9580). 

From the ground, observations were made with the Faulkes Telescope South (GCN 9574), with only upper limits available (R > 19.3, R > 1.0 coadded) in data obtained 120 seconds after the IBAS trigger. Similarly, for GROND observations, upper limits in its seven bands were all fainter than ~ 20.5 (GCN 9578)."</grb_description>

The UVOT starting observing the field 76 seconds after the trigger, but no OC was found In the initial data. The UVOT limiting magnitude was approximately 18 (unfiltered). 

Observations from the ground were not able to find an afterglow. However, observers using the 4.2 meter William Herschel Telescope in the Canary Islands obtained observations from ~1.7 to ~2.3 hours after the trigger. While they found no afterglow, they did find a very faint, non-variable object within the XRT error circle in their i-band images. No magnitude is reported (GCN 9547). Observers at the Russian-Turkish 1.5 meter telescope (Turkey) confirmed the object above, saying they marginally detect it. They also report a brighter, point-like object with Rc = 21.8 +/- 0.06 (based on USNO-B1). Their limiting magnitude is reported to be Rc ~ 23.6 (GCN 9549). 


The VLA was used to observe the field at 8.46 GHz beginning 14.6 hours after the burst. No source was found to a 3 sigma limit of 54 uJy (GCN 9555). "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst showed weak emission for ~8 seconds, but it was followed by a second trigger approximately 4 minutes later from the same location, possibly suggesting an extended prompt phase. The XRT began observing the field 117 seconds after the trigger. There was an uncatalogued, variable x-ray source within the BAT error circle. There was a  bright peak that occurred ~250 seconds after the trigger, another possible indication of an extended prompt phase. The UVOT also observed the field, but in the  initial 150 second finder chart exposure taken starting 122 seconds post-trigger, no OC is found.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a multi-peak structure and lasted about 130 seconds. The XRT began observing the field 121 seconds after the trigger and found a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also observed the field, beginning 128 seconds after the trigger. It found a candidate OC at m = 14.36 in a 150 seconds unfiltered finder chart exposure. 

From the ground, the OC was also seen by observers at the Palomar 60 telescope, who reported an magnitude r’ = 13.8 (GCN 9513). It was also seen by observers at the KAIT telescope (Lick observatory), who reported magnitudes as follows (GCN 9517):

t_mid(seconds) exp(s)     mag   mag_err
---------------------------------------
          76    2.0      13.61  0.03  
          92    2.0      13.99  0.04  
         117    2.0      13.50  0.03  
         237   20.0      14.02  0.02 
         436   20.0      14.73  0.02  
         729   20.0      15.26  0.02 
	    2601   20.0      16.22  0.02 
        7329  120.0      17.02  0.03  

They also fit a decay law to the light curve, with alpha = -1.08 +/- 0.05 up to ~600 seconds, and alpha = -0.70 +/- 0.02 thereafter.

Observers at the Shane 3m telescope, also at Lick Observatory, were able to obtain a spectrum of the OC beginning about 20 minutes after the trigger. Their spectrum covers the region from 3200 to 4400 Angstroms, and they report absorption features from Mg II, Mg I and Fe II, all at a redshift of z = 0.54. Since they see no Lyman-alpha absorption (implying z &lt; 1.6 given their wavelength range), they take this to be the redshift of the burst.

Inspection of the field of the GRB in SDSS images has shown a faint object corresponding to the position of the OC. The object is seen in the r (22.7 +/- 0.3) and I (22.2 +/- 0.4) frames, but not in u, g or z (GCN 9526). 

This is one of the few bursts detected in the radio. Observers using the AMI Large Array observed the field of the GRB in a band from 14.6 to 17.5 GHz. The observations were carried out from 18.25 to 21.25 hours after the trigger. The burst is clearly detected, with a flux density of 550 uJy (rms noise is 85 uJy). The observations indicate that the flux increased from 425 to 640 mJy between the first and second half of the observations, but this increase is not certain (GCN 9532).

The VLA was also used to observe the field. The observations, carried out at 8.46 GHz approximately a day after the burst, showed a source coinciding with the OC discovered by the P60 (GCN 9517) at a flux density of 383 +/- 47 uJy (GCN 9533). "

Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began observing with the XRT 70 seconds after the trigger. A fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was found. A mag 6.3 star within the UVOT field prevented prompt observations with that instrument, though images in u were obtained 75 seconds after the burst, with limits of u > 21.2 (GCN 9495). In later observations, taken several hours later, no OC was found to magnitudes fainter than 20 in uvw1 and v (GCN 9495).

From the ground, the Faulkes telescope north observed in the first 30 to 80 minutes after the burst in R and I’. No OC was found to fainter than 21 in each band (GCN 9492). Observations were also made with the GRAS001 0.3 meter telescope in New Mexico. The observations were done about an hour after the trigger.

The light curve was  FRED-like, with a duration of about 20 seconds. There will be no Swift followup observations with the XRT/UVOT due to unfavorable moon and sun positions. 

Observations were undertaken from the ground 32 hours after the burst using the GROND multi-color imager and the ESO 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla. Additional images were obtained one day later. No variable source was found between the two epochs to limiting magnitudes shown below (GCN 9402):

		<grb_description>"Swift slewed immediately to this burst. XRT began observing 115 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, uncatalogued source in the initial data. The initial UVOT observations were not able to identify a definitive afterglow candidate I the 150 second white light exposures begun at T+123 seconds.

The BAT light curve had several peaks which overlapped. The total burst duration was around 40 seconds. 

Observations at the TAROT robotic observatory in France began only 76 seconds after the trigger. They were able to put limits of R > 16.8 using the intial 60 second image. Slightly fainter limits (R > 18.5) were obtained by co-adding several images taken shortly thereafter (GCN 9401). Other limits were obtained using the FARO robotic telescope, also in France. These observations were begun 122 seconds after the trigger and had limits of R > 15.7 (GCN 9402). 

Observers using the NOT/ALFOSC were able to detect a fading afterglow in images ~20 and ~45 minutes after the trigger. The afterglow was at R ~ 21.6 (GCN 9403). This magnitude was later revised  after additional analysis of the field to R = 22.8 (GCN 9410).

Imaging done with GROND on the 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla was able to confirm the NOT source. In three of the GROND filters the object was seen in images taken 2.5 hours after the trigger. Employing the colors and dropout of the flux, a photometric redshift of z = 3.9 +0.4/-0.7 is obtained (GCN 9408).

Using the VLT, a spectrum was obtained which allowed the redshift of the object to be determined. Based on absorption from what are taken to be Lyman limit, Lyman-beta and Lyman-alpha at 4400, 5000 and 5900 Angstroms, resepctively, a redshift of z = 3.85 is indicated. This redshift is consistent with the photometric redshift obtained using GROND. (GCN 9409)"</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was a very long burst, lasting at least 150 seconds. Its light curve showed multiple peaks. The XRT began observing the field 167 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright, fading, uncatalogued X-ray source within the BAT error circle. Initial images from the UVOT, obtained starting 176 seconds after the trigger, showed no likely afterglow candidate. The images were taken in white light, and the 150 second exposures have a limiting magnitude of m = 19.6. 

From the ground images taken with the Faulkes 2 m telescope detected a fading afterglow with R ~ 19. Their BV and I images were taken approximately 17 minutes after the trigger (GCN 9375). Images from the 1 meter Zadko Telescope beginning 275 minutes after the trigger found a source which faded from m = 18.9 +/- 0.5 at T+275 minutes to m = 20.26 +/- 0.14 at T+296 minutes (GCN 9380). In addition, observers at the NOT were able to confirm this afterglow. Images taken 12.9 hours after the trigger revealed an object with R = 21.3 +/- 0.1 (GCN 9379). 

Images from the GROND instrument on the 2.2 meter ESO/MPI Telescope at La Silla were undertaken 14.6 hours after the GRB. The afterglow was detected in all seven filters, with magnitudes given below:

g =23.60 +-0.1
r =21.44 +-0.1
i =20.38 +-0.1
z =19.95 +-0.1
J =19.6  +-0.1
H =19.2  +-0.1
K =19.1  +-0.2

The SED from these observations suggests are photometric redshift of z ~ 4.1 +/- 0.3 (GCN 9382).

Using the FORS2 spectrograph on the ESO VLT, observations beginning 15.1 hours after the GRB showed an object with R ~ 21.2, consistent with the NOT results taken somewhat earlier. In addition, two spectra were obtained covering the wavelength region between 3500 and 9200 Angstroms. Preliminary analysis showed the presence of the Lyman limit, as well as Lyman-alpha absorption and absorption from S II, O I, C II, Si IV, Al II and others). The common redshift for these lines was z = 3.9 (GCN 9381). Reanalysis of these spectra discovered a slight offset in the wavelength zero-point, increasing the redshift slightly to z = 4.109 +/- 0.002 (GCN 9383).  "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was a short burst, lasting only 0.1 seconds. The satellite slewed and began observing with the XRT in 64 seconds, finding a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source within the BAT error circle. No optical transit was found in the initial unfiltered UVOT images, which began 72 seconds after the trigger and had exposures of 150 seconds.

Attempts to image an afterglow from the ground all yielded only upper limits. The earliest of these, obtained only 18 seconds after the trigger, came from the ROTSE-III Telescope at McDonald Observatory. They found limits of m > 18.4 for the first minute after the burst (using co-added images, GCN 9357).  Images taken with the 40 inch Nickel Telescope at Lick Observatory starting 7.8 minutes after the burst also failed to detect an afterglow to V > 20.5, with similar limites in B, I and R (GCN 9372). Other ground based observations taken much later but with larger aperture instruments also failed to detect any afterglow."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"Swift slewed immediately to this burst and began observing with the XRT 94 seconds after the trigger. The XRT found an uncatalogued source within the BAT error circle. Observations with the UVOT had begun at T+97 seconds. A 150 second unfiltered finder chart image found no afterglow candidate. However, a subsequent 250 seconds exposure begun at T+309 seconds in the U filter did find a candidate afterglow at U = 18.95. 

The afterglow was also seen by observers on the ground. Using the SMARTS/ANDICAM at CTIO in Chile, optical/NIR images revealed the afterglow in all seven filters from B to K (GCN 9333):

B= 20.18 +/- 0.13
V= 19.68 +/- 0.16
R= 19.02 +/- 0.10
I= 18.76 +/- 0.09
J= 17.70 +/- 0.16
H= 17.07 +/- 0.15
K= 16.48 +/- 0.22

The afterglow was also observed with the Nordic Optical Telescope in images beginning 4.7 hours after the trigger (GCN 9338).

In addition to the Swift detection, this burst was seen by Fermi with both the GBM and the LAT (GCN 9334, 9336).

A spectrum of this object was obtained using the VLT/FORS. Emission lines at 7093 and 9250 Angstroms are identified as [O II} and H-beta, respectively, at a redshift of z = 0.903. In addition, a break in the spectrum is observed near 7600 Angstrom, corresponding to the typical break at 4000 Angstrom at the same redshift as the emission lines. These spectral features are likely due to the host galaxy, not the burst itself (the spectrum was obtained ~2.3 days after the trigger, when the burst had already faded considerably), and indicate that the host for this burst is a star-forming galaxy, not an old elliptical (GCN 9353)."</grb_description>

Observers on the ground were also able to detect the OC for this burst. Using the ROTSE-III telescope at Siding Spring, Australia they detected a m = 15.5 object in an image taken ~6 minutes after the trigger (GCN 9224). The object was also observed by many other ground observers.

A spectrum of the afterglow was obtained using the Gemini South Telescope. They cover  wavelengths from 4400 to 8600 Angstrom and were taken beginning 11.7 hours after the trigger. The spectra show features from Ca II H+K at 6077 and 6130 Ang, respectively, as well as emission from  [O II] 3727 at 5758 Ang. These imply z = 0.544 (GCN 9243)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"The BAT light curve showed a double peaked structure with a duration of about 20 seconds. The XRT began observing the field 73 seconds after the trigger. A fading, uncatalogued object was found within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also observed the field, starting 77 seconds after the burst. No OC was found in the initial data.

From the ground, observations were made from several telescope. The Faulkes South Telescope started its set of observations 108 seconds after the trigger in B, R and I’. No OC was found to fairly bright magnitudes GCN 9200):

Similar limits were reported from the Palomar 60 inch telescope (GCN 9201). 

The first detection of the afterglow was reported by observers at the UKIRT. They observerd the field 20 minutes after the trigger and found a K-band object with K = 17.5 (GCN 9292).  

Subsequently, the GROND multiband imager was used in conjunction with the ESO 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla to obtain images in the visible and NIR. The results are shown in the table below:

Filter  Exp [s]    AB Mag   MagErr

K       480 x 10    20.9     0.1

These data were obtained ~15 hours after the trigger. Using the SED a photometric redshift for the object of z = 8.0 +0.5/-1.2 is deduced (GCN 9215). 

Spectra were also obtained for this object. The Amici telescope in the Canary Islands obtained a spectrum that showed no emission below 10,500 Ang, which implies z > 7.6 (GCN 9216). Additional spectra were obtained using the VLT in Chile. These spectra showed a spectral break at 11,200 Ang. Assuming this to be the Lyman break, the redshift for the object is z = 8.2 - the largest redshift measured for any object to date (GCN 9219). Subsequent reanalysis of the TNG Amici data gave results consistent with the VLT result: 7.6 &lt; z > 8.5 (GCN 9222).

A tentative detection was made at 3mm by observers at the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. The Flux density was reported as 0.2 mJy. This result is awaiting follow up observations to confirm variability (GCN 9273)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"Swift slewed immediately to this burst. XRT observations began 87 seconds after the trigger, and UVOT observations began 96 seconds after. The burst had a duration of about 80 seconds, with additional emission extending possibly as long as 100 seconds after the trigger. The XRT showed a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT images did not show any obvious afterglow candidate.  Upper limits fainter than m ~ 18 to 20 in the various UVOT filters (GCN 9094). 

Ground observers also failed to detect this afterglow, obtaining only upper limits."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst lasted 20 seconds and its light curve shows at least four overlapping peaks. The XRT began observing the field 73 seconds after the trigger. It found a bright uncatalogued source within the BAT error circe. No obvious OC candidate was seen in UVOT observations begun 81 seconds after the burst. However, subsequent analysis of UVOT data did find and OC in several bands, as shown in the table (GCN 9074):

		<grb_description>"Fermi detected this burst in both the GBM and the LAT. Emission was seen up to several GeV in the LAT. The burst had a complicated multi-peak light curve, with emission extending longer than 100 seconds in total. The object was following with the LAT for five hours after the trigger.

Followup observations of the LAT field using the Swift XRT revealed an uncatalogued x-ray source within the LAT error circle. The observations were begun approximately 16 hours after the GBM trigger (GCN 9045, 9046). Swift also performed observations with the UVOT and detected an optical OC with magnitudes listed below (GCN 9048):

		<grb_description>"This burst was detected by Fermi in both the GBM and the LAT. In the LAT, emission was seen to extend up to a few GeV, with the high energy emission beginning several seconds after the GBM trigger. The light curve contained multiple peaks and lasted ~150 seconds, but there is marginal evidence that the high energy emission lasted for a couple of kiloseconds. The burst location was tracked by Fermi for five hours, subject to Earth angle constraints. 

The Swift observatory began a TOO observation of this GRB at 19:27UT on 2009/03/23. With 1137 seconds of XRT in photon counting mode an uncatalogued x-ray source was found within the Fermi LAT error circle (GCN 9024).

From the ground, observers using the GROND multiband imager detected an afterglow candidate in the NIR. The observations started 26 hours 48 minutes after the trigger. The observations confirm the Swift XRT point source. With 8 minutes of exposure the following magnitudes were obtained (GCN 9026):

g' = 21.64 +/- 0.07 mag,

r' = 20.03 +/- 0.03 mag,

i' = 19.64 +/- 0.02 mag,

z' = 19.39 +/- 0.02 mag,

J = 19.24 +/- 0.02 mag,

H = 18.86 +/- 0.02 mag, and

K = 18.58 +/- 0.03 mag

The object was also detected in observations from the Palomar 60” telescope at r’ = 20.5, I’ = 20.0. These observations began 28 hours 18 minutes after the trigger (GCN 9027).

A redshift for the afterglow was obtained using the Gemini South Telescope. Spectra obtained about 30 hours after the trigger showed strong absorption blueward of 5580 Ang. This was taken to be the onset of the Lyman Alpha forest, suggesting z = 3.6. In addition, multiple narrow absorption features were seen from C IV, O I, C II and Si IV at a similar redshift (z = 3.57, GCN 9028) "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This was a BAT image trigger. The burst showed multiple peaks starting approximately 10 seconds before the trigger and continuing to 40 seconds past. Because it was an image trigger there was limited BAT data, and the position of the Moon prevented the satellite from slewing to collect XRT/UVOT data. 

The KAIT telescope at Lick Observatory was used to observe the field and a bright m~16 object was seen, though no time for this observation was given. This object was not visible in the DSS plate. (GCN 8979). 

Observers at at the La Silla ESO/MPI 2.2 meter telescope used the GROND imager to obtain data of the field beginning 7 minutes after the trigger. They detected the object reported above in all bands (g’, r’, I’, z’, JHK). Their preliminary magnitudes are as follows (GCN 8983):

J = 14.0 +/- 0.1
H = 13.1 +/- 0.1
K = 12.3 +/- 0.1

Barger of Harvard did a close inspection of SDSS survey images and found a faint, extended source coincident with the position of the OC (GCN 8984).

The Faulkes Telescope north was used to image the OC at three different epochs. The object brightened about 20 minutes after the trigger, then dimmed and flattened out around 3 hours past the initial burst. (GCN 8989). 

A redshift of the afterglow was obtained using the Gemini South telescope. Based on absorption from C IV, Al II, O I, Si II, Si IV, Fe II, Lyman-alpha and Sil II*. These all lie at a common redshift of z = 3.375, which is taken to be the redshift of the GRB. (GCN 8994) 

Observations from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope did not detect the afterglow at 4.9 GHz in observations taken about two days after the trigger (GCN 9000). However, using the AMI Large Array to observe frequencies from 14.5 to 17.5 GHz the afterglow as detected; it had a flux density of 820 +/- 71 uJy ~ 2 days after the burst (GCN 9003). In addition, observers using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy report detecting the afterglow approximately a day after the burst at 92.5 GHz. The flux density was 4.0 +/- 0.6 mJy."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This BAT image trigger burst showed a weak peak from T+20 to T+35 seconds. The satellite slewed immediately, and the XRT started observing the field 127 seconds after the trigger. A fading, uncatalogued source was found within the BAT error circle.  In a 150 second exposure with the UVOT begun 131 seconds after the trigger, no credible OC was found.

Observations using the GROND instrument on the 2.2 meter ESO/MPI telescope were begun approximately 29.5 hours after the trigger. No OC was detected, but upper limits were obtained, as given in the table below (GCN 8958):

		<grb_description>"Swift slewed immediately after the BAT trigger and began observations with the XRT 135 seconds after the burst. An uncatalogued xray source was found, though it did not appear to fade in the initial data. The UVOT also observed the field, but not credible OC was found in the initial 150 second finder chart exposure. The trigger was sub-threshold, and as a result this burst was originally reported as “probably not a GRB.”

Subsequent observations with the XRT found that the source had indeed faded over ~1 day following the trigger. The fading afterglow confirms the object as a GRB (GCN 8946). 

The following upper limits for any optical/NIR candidate were obtained with GROND on the 2.2 meter ESO/MPI telescope in imagery begun 80 minutes after the trigger (GCN 8959).

XRT began observing the field 93 seconds after the trigger, but no source was detected in the immediately available data. Swift observed only 92.8 seconds before slewing away. The UVOT took at 96 second unfiltered exposure beginning 102 seconds after the exposure. No OC was detected. 

From the ground, observers using the GMOS on Gemini South began imaging the field 27 minutes after the trigger. These observations in Sloan g’, r’ and I’ covered almost the entire BAT error circle. A fading point source was found at R ~23.3; it faded approximately 1.1 mag over the next two hours (GCN 8933). 

Confirmation of the above OC was made by observers at Magellan, using IMACS on the Baade 6.5 meter telescope. Observations in R at T+88 minutes and T+231 minutes. These observations confirmed the fading behavior mentioned above, and are a strong indication that this is the afterglow of the GRB. (GCN 8934)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>"This burst had a single peak and lasted 10 seconds. The XRT began observing the field ~87 seconds after the trigger, detecting an uncatalogued source within the the BAT error circle. In a 150 second finding chart exposure starting 92 seconds after the trigger, the UVOT did not detect any optical candidate (unfiltered image).  

From the ground, the VLT reported an optical candidate in images taken 7.1 hours after the trigger. Their R and I band images, taken with the FORS1 camera, detected an object within the enhanced XRT error circle at R=22.0 (GCN 8887). Subsequent observations taken ~2.5 hours later using spectroscopic mode revealed broad absorption around 6800 Angstroms (observed), which if interpreted as Ly-alpha indicates a redshift of z = 4.6 (GCN 8889). This result is consistent with that obtained using the GROND instrument at La Silla, which detected the OC in all filters from I’ redward; interpreting the blue dropout below I’ as Ly-alpha also suggests a redshift of z ~4.7 (GCN 8888). 

Additional analysis from the VLT spectra enabled detection of the following absorption features: Ly-alpha (1215.67), SiII (1260.66), SiII (1303.27), CII (1334.53), SiIV (1393.76, 1402.77), SiII (1526.71) and CIV (1548.20, 1550.77), all at z = 4.6497 +/- 0.0025 (GCN 8892).

Followup observations taken with the VLT 1.35 days after the trigger showed that the OC had faded approximately 3 magnitudes since the first VLT observations (GCN 8895).

Observations taken from the VLA on Jan 07.50 did not show any radio afterglow to 21 +/- 47 uJy (GCN 8896). "</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was detected in the BAT Slew Survey. It had a duration T90 = 16 seconds.

Observations taken with the XRT beginning approximately seven hours after the slew detection failed to reveal any afterglow candidate (GCN 8828). Similarly, optical observations from the UVOT and from the ground yielded only faint upper limits on the brightness of any OT (GCN 8827 and 8826). A possible OT was reported in observations from the KPNO 4 meter telescope (GCN 8829), but later observations from that same telescope (GCN 8831) and from the Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea (GCN 8832) did not show any fading over more than a day.</grb_description>

Swift began observing the field using the XRT approximately 13.7 kiloseconds after the SuperAGILE trigger. An uncatalogued source source was seen within the SA error circle. *GCN 8818). Further observations with the XRT showed the source to be fading, confirming it to be the afterglow of the GRB (GCN 8823).  The GRB was also detected by the Fermi GBM (GCN 8821).

		<grb_description>This burst lasted 20 seconds. The satellite slewed immediately and the XRT began observing 71 seconds after the trigger. No x-ray source was detected. Similarly, in a 150 second finder chart exposure (unfiltered) taken with the UVOT beginning 79 seconds after the trigger, no OC was found. Subsequent analysis of the XRT data did reveal an uncatalogued source within the BAT error circle (GCN 8806).  Monitoring of the source showed it to be decaying according to a power law, suggesting that this was indeed the afterglow of the GRB (GCN 8811). 

Observers from the ground also failed to detect any OC. The first reported images were from the ROTSE-III telescope, which found limiting magnitudes (unfiltered) near m = 17 in the first 20 minutes after the burst (GCN 8807).  Much fainter limits were set (at later times) by the NOT telescope on La Palma (R >  23.4 ~2 hours post trigger - GCN 8810) and the La Silla MPI/ESO 2.2m telescope/GROND (magnitudes greater than 20 to 23 for its various NIR bands - GCN 8812). Similar limits were reported from the Mt Lemmon Optical Observatory in Arizona for observations in R and I: R > 21.1 at T0+07:19:49 and I > 20.5 at T0+07:49:08 (GCN 8814).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The duration of this burst was 20 seconds. It had a two-peaked light curve and was also detected by the Fermi GBM as trigger 25303844, with duration of 24 seconds and two-peaked structure, as seen by INTEGRAL (GCN 8793). This same structure was seen by WAM on Suzaku; in the WAM energy band the burst lasted only 14 seconds (GCN 8794).

In followup observations from the ground, no OC was reported, only upper limits. The Swift satellite used the XRT to follow up, and in observations begun 4.2 kiloseconds after the trigger and lasting 1314 seconds a single uncatalogued source was found (GCN 9789). The source was later confirmed at the afterglow by additional Swift XRT observations (GCN 8791).

The ROTSE-III telescope was used to obtain limits of  m = 16.6 and 17.7 at T0+20 seconds and T0+278 seconds, respectively (GCN 8787). Observations reported by the AAVSO put even fainter limits: m = 20.5 obtained using a 0.4 m telescope and SBIG camera using 10 stacked 60 second exposures. These images were begun 15 minutes after the trigger (GCN 8788).

		<grb_description>The BAT-detected burst had a duration of approximately 30 seconds and showed a multi-peaked light curve, with some emission starting about 15 seconds prior to the trigger. The XRT began observing the field 387 seconds after the trigger and found a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also began observing the field (T0+395), and in a 150  second unfiltered image found an m = 18.1 object.

Observers on the ground also detected the afterglow for this burst. Using the REM telescope on La Silla, observers reported seeing an R~14.2 object in observations begun 35 seconds after the triigger (GCN 8763). Observers at the TAROT Calern observatory made observations beginning at around the same time and continuing for approximately 3 minutes past the trigger. They also noted the R~14 object around 40 seconds after the trigger. They followed it to R=15.5 at T0+181.6 seconds (GCN 8764).  Observers using the NOT/ALFOSC obtained a spectrum of the object in a 45 minute exposure begun around T0+38 minutes. They report an upper limit on the redshift of z &lt; 2.1 due to the lack of Ly-alpha emission seen. They also report detecting several metal lines: Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, Al II, Al III and C IV, and from these deduce a redshift of z = 1.547. (GCN 8766). These spectroscopic results were confirmed using the Palomar 200” telescope (GCN 8773). The object was also detected by observations using the GROND instrument at La Silla (GCN 8771) and IAC80 (GCN 8772). </grb_description>

No OC was initially reported in a 250 second U-filter finder chart image, however, subsequent analysis revealed the presence of a U = 20.6 object (GCN 8755). Additional analysis also revealed detections in the v and b filters, and in the unfiltered images obtained. The v image obtained at T~10 minutes showed a v = 18.3 object (GCN 8757).

		<grb_description>This was a short burst, lasting only 0.5 seconds. The satellite slewed immediately, and the XRT began observing ~95 seconds after the trigger. An uncatalogued x-ray source was found. No data was immediately available from the prompt UVOT data. 

Imaging from the ground began 8.8 seconds after the burst from Namibia using the ROTSE-IIIc. No source was detected to limits around m = 17 - 18 (GCN 8730). However, observers using the GROND imager on the 2.2 meter telescope at La Silla were able to detect a faint source in the XRT error circle. They report r’ = 24.3 in observations started 11 minutes after the trigger. No information is given for their other filters (GCN 8731). In addition, a spectrum of this source was obtained using the Gemini-South telescope. In the wavelength range 4000 - 8000A, no features are seen, only a smooth continuum (GCN 8733). Subsequent images taken with Gemini-South showed that the source reported above had not varied in brightness during the 1.62 hours between exposures (GCN 8736).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This FRED burst lasted approximately 50 seconds. It had a FWHM of 15 seconds. Initially, a simultaneous detection and localization from the LAT was reported, but this was later retracted (GCN 8726).

The Swift XRT was used to make follow-up observations beginning 18 kiloseconds after the trigger. A faint x-ray source was detected, but it was not certain that this was the afterglow, as the XRT FOV is smaller than the GBM/LAT error circle (but see above regarding the LAT detection). This set of observations was not sufficient to tell whether or not the source was fading (GCN 8725). </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had a duration of 20 seconds. It had a multipeaked structure. The XRT began observations 52 seconds after the trigger and found a fading, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT started observations at T0+60 seconds and also found a source consistent with that of the XRT, but neither position nor magnitude were immediately available. Subsequent observations and analysis showed that these first images had the magnitude of the object at m = 14.84 in white light at T0+60 seconds, and that it faded rapidly in subsequent exposures, to m = 17.36 at 873 seconds. (GCN 8696)

The REM telescope at La Silla began observing the field 28 seconds after the trigger. It detected a bright object with H~11.1 at approximately 1 minute after the burst (GCN 8692). Additional observations were undertaken from La Silla using the GROND multiband imager. In observations started approximately 32 minutes after the trigger, they detected the afterglow in all filters, with magnitudes given below:

--------------------------------------------
g'      19.08 +/- 0.01    115    05:27:13
i'      18.04 +/- 0.01    115    05:27:13

K       14.92 +/- 0.03    480    05:29:18

Tracking problems prevented a determination of a magnitude in r’, though the source was detected at that wavelength band (GCN 8693).

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to this burst. It had two peaks , the first lasting from 0 to 10 seconds after the trigger, the second, larger peak lasting from 15 to 40 seconds. The XRT began observations at T0+68 seconds and found a bright, fading uncatalogued source. The UVOT also observed the field, beginning 78 seconds after the trigger, but no significant afterglow candidate was found. Subsequent analysis yielded faint upper limits for any source, varying from ~18 to ~21 for the initial observations (GCN 8703).

From the ground no afterglow candidate has been claimed. Limits of I ~ 23 are reported from observers using the NOT telescope. Their observations were made approximately four hours after the trigger (GCN 8689).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was detected during a slew of Swift in the BAT slew survey. It was seen to 7.4 and 8.3 sigma in the 15 - 50 keV and 15 - 150 keV energy bands, respectively. The lightcurve suggested two peaks during the 102 seconds that he source was within the BAT FOV. Possibly, only the decay was seen of an earlier GRB that occurred at that position. 

Followup observations with the XRT taken 81.6 ks after the slew found a single, uncatalogued source within the BATSS error circle (GCN 8666).

Konus-Wind detected a short spike while in waiting mode that was consistent in time and position with the GRB. Golenetskii et al. (GCN 8676) propose that this spike was the actual burst associated with GRB 081211B, and that the BATSS source is the extended emission from this burst.</grb_description>

The XRT began observing the field 72 seconds after the trigger and found a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source. The UVOT also began observations at around this time (T0+80 seconds) and found an afterglow candidate with m = 19.12 in white light. 

Imaging with the ANDICAM on the 1.3 meter Cerro Tololo telescope performed 6.2 hours after the trigger failed to detect any optical afterglow to limiting magnitudes of I > 22.3 and J > 20.0 (GCN 8659) Observers using the Xinglong TNT were also unable to detect any afterglow. Their limits were R > 19.571 at T0+17.814 hr (GCN 8660).

		<grb_description>INTEGRAL detected this burst. It had a duration of ~20 seconds. The Swift XRT was able to begin observing the field at T+2:45 and detected a single source within the INTEGRAL error box (GCN 8619). Subsequent observations with the XRT confirmed the presence of the source and showed that it had faded in the intervening ~30 minutes, thus confirming that it was the GRB afterglow (GCN 8620). UVOT observations taken at roughly the same time as the x-ray data yielded only upper limits: m > 22.04 in the White filter (GCN 8621).

Observations from the MegellanClay telescope taken 8.86 hr after the trigger showed a faint object with r = 23.5 +/- 0.3 and i = 23.0 +/- 0.2.  This was the only object detected within the error circle (GCN 8627). Observations from La Silla with the GROND instrument on the 2.2 m ESO/MPI telescope yielded only faint upper limits on the brightness in all filters, from g’ (>24.2) through K (>18.3) (GCN 8627).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to this burst and began observing with the XRT and UVOT. The burst had a two-peak structure and lasted approximately 70 seconds. In observations begun 83 seconds after the trigger, XRT detected a bright, uncatalogued source. The UVOT started observing 92 seconds after the trigger and in a 150 second finder chart exposure detected an m - 14.55 (in white) object. The UVOT was also able to obtain a GRISM spectrum from which a tentative redshift of z ~ 2.1 was inferred, assuming spectral features from the Lyman edge (at 2850 A) and Lyman alpha absorption (3850 A, GCN 8601).

On the ground, observers using Skynet to control the GORT telescope in Sonoma County, Northern California, obtained five images beginning ~120 seconds after the trigger. The R and I images all show the GRB afterglow at about R ~12.5. Imaging was stopped after about ten minutes due to the increasing morning twilight. The magnitudes and times of the GORT images are given below (GCN 8617):

mean time

235             40              R               12.60 +/- 0.01
345             40              I               11.58 +/- 0.01
476             80              R               12.51 +/- 0.01
625             80              I               12.02 +/- 0.01

Observers at the Astronomical Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences also reported detecting the afterglow in observations begun approximately 90 minutes after the trigger and continuing for another ~90 minutes. In the period of these observations the afterglow faded from R~15.7 to R~17.2 (GCN 8604).  The object was also detected by Konus-Wind, starting 80 seconds before the BAT trigger (GCN 8611). Additional ground-based detections were reported from Mt. Terkol observatory in Russia (GCN 8615), the TNT telescope in China (GCN 8618) and the MITSuME Telescope in Japan (GCN 8619). All of these optical observations were taken several hours after the trigger. 

Observations in the radio yielded upper limits on the afterglow flux. At 8.46 GHz the VLA reported limits of 76 +/- 54 uJy. Observers at the AMI large array reported upper limits of 116 +/- 300 uJy and 80 +/- 200 uJy at 15 Ghz in observations taken on Nov 04.26 and 05.24, respectively (GCN 8623).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was detected by the BAT Slew Survey. The burst was seen simultaneously in the 15 - 50 keV and 50 - 150 keV bands. The light curve showed two main peaks. The larger one started at T+24 seconds, while the smaller one started at T+30 seconds. Both were 2 seconds long. The total duration for the burst was T90 = 23.4 seconds. 

The Swift XRT began observing this burst 16.7 ks after the trigger. A single uncatalogued source was detected within the error circle. Given the low statistics of the observation, it was not possible to determine immediately if the source was fading (GCN 8605) . However, additional observations using the UVOT taken 4.6 hours after the trigger revealed a fading source at 18.29 +/- 0.04 (in white) (GCN 8606).

From the ground, observers at the Mt. Terskol observatory reported seeing the afterglow at R=19.8 in observations taken ~12 hours after the trigger (GCN 8608).

The burst was also seen by Konus-Wind. It showed a multipeaked structure and had a duration of ~80 seconds (GCN 8610).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was observed with the XRT beginning 198 seconds after the trigger. A bright, uncatalogued source was found within the BAT error circle. A 150 second finding chart exposure begun shortly after the XRT observations did not show any likely optical afterglow.

From the ground, several observers were able to track down a very faint afterglow for this burst. Observers at Xinglong TNT reported a possible afterglow at R~20.9 500 seconds after the burst, though they were not able to see any fading (GCN 8572). Similar results were obtained using the Lulin 1m telescope beginning approximately 11 minutes after the trigger (GCN 8575) and by observers using the Z-600 telescope at Mt. Terskol Observatory (GCN 8576). The afterglow was finally seen to be fading by observers at the Liverpool Telescope in observations obtained nearly 7 hours after the trigger (GCN 8577). </grb_description>

		<grb_description>The Swift BAT detected and localized this burst, which had a duration of 40 seconds and a double peaked structure. The XRT began observing the field 66 seconds after the trigger. It found a bright, uncatalogued source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also began observing the field, beginning 75 seconds after the trigger. In a 150 second exposure in white light, no afterglow candidate was found. Subsequent observations with the UVOT found only upper limits (GCN 8559).

On the ground, observers at the Terskol Observatory in Russia reported a possible afterglow candidate slightly outside the XRT error circle (GCN 8558). That this object was the afterglow was confirmed by a reexamination of the UVOT data, which showed that the object was fading (GCN 8564). The UVOT magnitudes are as follows:

		<grb_description>Earth limb constraint delayed observations by the XRT and UVOT. The burst had a single FRED profile with a duration of approximately 15 seconds, though some emission was still evident out to 100 seconds. The UVOT began observing the field ~47 minutes after the trigger and found an afterglow candidate in its initial 150 second white light finder chart exposure. The magnitude of the source was m ~ 18 (GCN 8538). The XRT was also able to detect the source (GCN 8541). The burst was also detected by the GBM aboard Fermi (GCN 8546).

From the ground, the afterglow was imaged by observers at La Silla using the GROND multi-band imager on the 2.2 meter telescope. The observations were begun 3.9 hours after the trigger at very high airmass (2.35). The magnitudes are as follows (GCN 8540):

g' = 19.1
r' = 18.8
i' = 18.6
z' = 18.5
J  = 18.4
H  = 18.2
K  = 18.1 

Additionally, the burst was detected by the ANDICAM on the 1.3 meter telescope at CTIO. These observations were done approximately 5 hours after the trigger and showed the following magnitudes (GCN 8547):

B = 19.34 +/- 0.04
R = 18.61 +/- 0.04
I = 18.21 +/- 0.04
J = 17.21 +/- 0.15
H = 17.05 +/- 0.15
K = 16.75 +/- 0.15

Working with the Magellan/Clay 6.5 meter telescope at Las Campanas, observers were able to obtain a redshift of the afterglow: z = 2.512. This measurement is based on absorption features from Lyman-alpha, SiII, CII, SiIV, CIV, FeII and AlII (GCN 8542). 

This burst was also detected by Konus-Wind. It showed a multipeaked structure and a duration of ~18 seconds. (GCN 8548)</grb_description>

		<grb_description>BAT detected and localized this burst, and Swift slewed immediately to begin observations with the XRT and UVOT. The XRT found a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source in observations begun 153 seconds after the trigger. The UVOT did not find any candidate afterglow in the initial 150 second unfiltered finder chart exposure. The UVOT exposure was started 164 seconds after the trigger.

On the ground, observers using the VLT were able to image the field and find a faint source, R  = 22.5 on the edge of the XRT error circle. The observations were done 10 hours after the trigger (GCN 8528). This source was also detected in all bands using the GROND multi-object imager on the 2.2m telescope at La Silla (GCN 8529). 

Switching to spectroscopy mode, the VLT observers were able to measure the redshift of the source: z = 2.58. This is based on identifications of Ly-alpha, SiII (1260), SiII (1304), CII (1334), SiIV (1393, 1402), SiII (1526), CIV (1548, 1550), FeII (1608), AlII (1670), SiII(1808) and AlIII (1854) - (GCN 8531).

Observers using the VLA observed the field at 8.46 GHz approximately 54 hours after the trigger. They detect no afterglow, measuring a flux of -70 +/- 60 uJy.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The BAT light curve for this burst had a triangular structure and a duration of about 40 seconds.The satellite slewed immediately to the burst, and the XRT began observations 66 seconds after the trigger. A bright, uncatalogued source was seen within the BAT error circle. The UVOT made a finding chart observation beginning 75 seconds after the trigger. No afterglow candidate was seen in the initial 150 second unfiltered finder chart exposure. However, subsequent analysis of these images did show a tentative confirmation of the object seen by the REM observers (see below) with m = 21.6. All observations in various UVOT filters gave only upper limits (GCN 8509).

Observers on the ground faired better with this burst. The REM telescope at La Silla, Chile, was used to image the field starting 52 seconds after the trigger. They found only upper limits in R and J, but they also report a variable object with H = 15.47 and K = 14.51. The object subsequently brightened to K =14.27  (GCN 8501)

The field was also observed using the 2.2 meter Faulkes Telescope South beginning 4.81 hours after the burst. No afterglow was seen to limiting magnitudes of R = 21.0 and i’ = 21.2 (GCN 8508).

At the 2.2 meter ESO/MPI telescope using the GROND multiband imager, observers reported seeing the afterglow in all but one filter. The observations were undertaken 17.1 hours after the burst trigger. Magnitudes are given below (GAN 8510).

		<grb_description>The duration of this multipeaked burst was 30 seconds. Swift was unable to slew immediately to observe the burst due  to an observing constraint. After a delay of approximately 40 minutes, the satellite slewed and observed the field with the XRT. An uncatalogued source was observed within the BAT error circle. 

No ground observers have confirmed a definitive detection of the afterglow. The Faulkes Telescope South reported upper limits or R > 21.9 in observations nearly 3 hours after the burst (GCN 8475). Observers using the GROND multi-filter camera at La Silla reported a possible candidate with magnitudes as follows (GCN 8482)

g' ~ 22.7 mag,

i' ~ 21.8 mag, 
z' ~ 21.7 mag,

However, the reported source is on the edge of the error circle. No information about fading was available. </grb_description>

At the Skinakes Observatory, the OPTIMA-Burst instrument was used to image the field 18 minutes after the burst, but nothing was seen to limits of m = 18.5 (unfiltered, GCN 8463).

		<grb_description>The burst had a very low merit value, and as I result Swift did not slew to observer with the XRT or UVOT. In addition, the source was close to a BH candidate (A0620-00), though its 18 arcminute separation makes it unlikely that the gamma-ray spike originated with the BHC. In addition, the hard spectrum of the GRB is not typical of a SGR, suggesting that this was an actual GRB. It had a duration of less than 128 milliseconds. </grb_description>

The afterglow was detected in observations from the ROTSE-III telescope in Namibia. The observations were started 86 seconds after the trigger, and a m = 16.5 (unfiltered), fading object was found. The object is not present on DSS images of the field (GCN 8436). The object was also observed using the GROND instrument at La Silla, with r’ = 17.8 in observations begun 8.2 minutes after the trigger (GCN 8437). 

Observations with the UVES camera on the VLT were used to obtain spectra of the object from 300 - 1000 nm. Absorption features of SiII, OI, CII were seen. The redshift obtained is z = 3.8479 +/- 0.0002 (GCN 8438). This redshift was confirmed using the Gemini South telescope (GCN 8448).

Subsequent observations with the XRT (GCN 8443, 8446) and UVOT (GCN 8450) also detected the afterglow. In addition, the afterglow was detected from the REM telescope (GCN 8441), the PROMPT telescopes at Cerro Tololo (GCN 8449) and SMARTS (GCN 8452).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The burst had a duration of approximately 250 seconds. Swift slewed immediately and began observations with the XRT (191 seconds) and UVOT (200 seconds). The XRT detected an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. No afterglow was seen by the UVOT in the initial analysis of the 150 second finder chart exposure.

However, observers using the GROND instrument in the 2.2 meter ESO/MPI telescope on La Silla were able to detect the afterglow in all their filters, as indicated by their table, reproduced below (GCN 8424):


g' = 19.9
r' = 19.3
i' = 19.2
z' = 19.1
J  = 19.0

However, subsequent observations from the UVOT (GCN 8430) did not confirm this object, however, observations from the UVOT did finally see a brightening afterglow. The following magnitudes and limits were reported (GCN 8431):

Observers at the NOT telescope also detected the afterglow, reporting R = 15.7 (GCN 8425).The Tarot robotic telescope was used to observe the field, but due to its low position in the sky, no useful data was obtained until more than an hour after the trigger. No object was detected to R ~ 17.4 (GCN 8426)

The Magellan/Clay 6.5 meter telescope and Magellan Echellette Spectrgraph were used to obtain  the redshift of the afterglow. Based on absorption from Ly-alpha, SII, NV, SiIV, CIV, FeII and others, the redshift is z = 3.038 (GCN 8343).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This Fermi-detected burst was seen both in the LAT and the GBM. It had a duration of 800 milliseconds and showed two main peaks. The first peak lasted 200 ms and its spectrum was fit by a power-law with exponential cutoff. The power-law index was -0.7 +/- 0.13 and the cutoff energy was 1583 +/- 520 keV. The second peak lasted 600 ms and was fit by a power-law of index -1.28 _/- 0.04.

LAT observations showed emission from this burst up to 3 GeV in the first 5 seconds following the trigger. . 

Swift was able to slew to this source and begin observing 70.3 ks after the trigger, It detected three uncatalogued x-ray sources within the LAT error-circle. Subsequent observations undertaken approximately 1.5 days after the trigger showed two of the three sources. The other source was not detected, but due to photon statistics the observations could not unequivocally confirm fading. Additional observations performed 6 days after the trigger also did not detect this source (while still detecting the other two). However, these observations, when combined with the earlier ones, did detect the second source (R = 22.6), and suggested a 12% probability that it was not fading. It also suggested a possible association with a variable optical object (see below). Nonetheless, these observations could not confirm this source as the x-ray afterglow candidate (GCN 8454).

In the meantime, observers using the Palomar 200 inch Hale Telescope imaged the LAT error circule in Sloan r’ and i’, starting approximately 30 hours after the burst. They detected 4 sources close to the possible x-ray afterglow candidate (see above). These ranged in brightness from R = 20.6 to 23.4. None of the detected objects showed any sign of variability, and one of them was seen on the DSS (GCN 8417).

This burst was also detected by the SUZAKU instrument. It showed a double-peaked structure, as in the GBM, but it’s duration was 0.4 second (T90).  (GCN 8444) </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a short burst, with a duration of 0.3 seconds and a precursor peak at T-2.5 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and commenced observations with the XRT 72 seconds after the trigger. The XRT detected an uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT began observations 76 seconds after the trigger. No afterglow candidate was evident in the 150 second finder chart image to approximately m = 18 (white). Subsequent analysis of UVOT observations pushed these limits to fainter than 19.9 in v. 

From the ground, several groups imaged the field. The faintest limits were by the Faulkes Telescope in Hawaii, which began observing approximately 50 seconds after the trigger. Limits were R > 21.4 (at 2.25 min), R > 22.6 (at 112.8 min) and I > 21.2 (at 136.2 min).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This single peak burst had a duration of 5 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to begin observations with the XRT (91 seconds) and UVOT (93 seconds). The former showed an uncatalogued, fading source within the BAT error circle. The 150 second initial white light exposure in the UVOT did not show any source to a limit around m = 18.

Observers at the ROTSE-IIIc telescope in Namibia began observations within 7 seconds of the GCN notification time. They detected no source to m=17.5 at 45 seconds (GCN 8382).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Due to Earth limb constraint, Swift was not able to slew immediately to this burst. In data obtained by the XRT 49 minutes after the burst, and uncatalogued point source was detected (GCN 8364). Observations taken with the UVOT shortly thereafter (at 52 minutes) did not reveal any source. Upper limits are below (GCN 8365):

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to this burst, which had a duration of approximately 15 seconds. The XRT began observing 94 seconds after the trigger, but no source was found by the initial analysis within the BAT error circle. The UVOT started observing 98 seconds after the trigger, and it also found no source in its 150 second exposure to approximately m = 18.5. Subsequent analysis of the XRT did reveal an uncatalogued x-ray source, as did that of the UVOT. Their magnitudes, which have not been extinction corrected, are below:

		<grb_description>This burst was not immediately observed by Swift because of sun constraint.  In addition, the initial light curve data were truncated due to issues related to the downlink and the South Atlantic Anomaly. The available data run for 8 seconds. Subsequent analysis of data obtained in a later downlink showed that the burst lasted over 20 seconds (T90~21 seconds, GCN 7726)</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The duration of this burst was ~25 seconds. It had a double-peaked structure. Swift slewed immediately to the burst location and began XRT observations 99 seconds after the trigger. A bright uncatalogued x-ray source was seen within the BAT error circle. Starting at 108 seconds after the trigger, the UVOT took a white light 100 second long exposure and found a 17.0 magnitude object.

Observers from the ground we able to detect this burst in the optical. The REM telescope at La Silla began its observations 45 seconds after the trigger at H~14.2. The source was slowly fading after their initial observations (GCN 8331).  Using the 1.3 m telescope at Cerro Tololo, observers obtained optical/IR images of the field that showed the afterglow candidate faded by 0.6 magnitudes (R) in the period from 23 minutes to 56 minutes after the trigger (GCN 8332). Observers using the Faulkes telescope in Hawaii also noted this behavior. Their magnitudes are (GCN 8333):

Filter  Mag		T_mid[min]
-----------------------------
R       17.9 +/- 0.4	17.50
R       18.6 +/- 0.4	46.66

I       17.1 +/- 0.4	21.55
I       17.6 +/- 0.4	39.38
-----------------------------

The afterglow was also detected with four of the five PROMPT telescopes at CTIO. They report a magnitude of I ~ 14.8 121 seconds after the burst.

In the radio, the afterglow was detected by the VLA at 8.46 GHz. The flux was 0.32 +/- 0.03 mJy at 9.19 UT on Oct 9, ~34 hours after the burst.

A spectrum taken with the Gemini North telescope was used to determine the redshift of the burst: z = 0.5295 +/- 0.0001. The features used were CaII H&amp;K and [OII] 3727 (GCN 8335). 

Subsequent work has shown that the GRB was associated with a supernova. In imaging done using the Gemini  South GMOS instrument in late October, and again in early November and December, a fading is seen that is consistent with a supernova lightcurve (GCN 8662).

		<grb_description>This was a BAT image trigger. Swift slewed immediately and began observing with the XRT (T0+170 seconds) and UVOT (T0+179 seconds). The XRT found a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also found an afterglow candidate within the error circle with m`19.2 (unfiltered). 

The optical counterpart was confirmed by ground observers at ROTSE-III, who found an object with m = 16.9 and 16.2, respectively, in exposures taken 500 and 2000 seconds after the trigger.  (GCN 8293). Observers using GROND also found the object. They report detections in all optical bands (GCN 8296). In addition, observers using the Watcher telescope in South Africa reported detecting the object at R=19.37 in exposures taken ~10.6 hours after the trigger (GCN 8303).

Redshifts for this object were obtained using the Gemini South telescope who report z=2.49 based on the presence of the Lyman alpha break and absorption features caused by Fe II, Si IV, C IV and Ni II, (GCN 8300). However, these results were later retracted and attributed to spurious features due to poor sky line subtraction (GCN 8304). Observers at the VLT report a different result. They find lines of Mg II, and Fe II, but no Lyman break. The redshift the derive is z=1.692 (GCN 8301).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This short burst, with a duration of 1 second, was detected by Swift, which slewed immediately and began observations with the XRT 71 seconds after the trigger. The XRT showed a fading, uncatalogued x-ray source 199 seconds from the BAT position and outside the BAT error circle. The UVOT observed an area covering the BAT error circle, but none of the XRT error circle. No afterglow was seen in the UVOT data.

Observers at the REM telescope (La Silla) began imaging the field 74 seconds after the trigger. They detected a possible afterglow candidate at H~14.0, but due to technical difficulties, their images are not of high enough quality to positively associate their source with the x-ray source observed by Swift (GCN 8271). Subsequent observations using the UVOT were not able to find any optical candidate associated with the x-ray transient seen by the XRT. They do detect the source reported from REM, but the source shows no fading (GCN 8277).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had a duration of 20 seconds. Due to an Earth limb constraint, Swift was not able to slew to the source for 62 minutes. Upon clearing the constraint, XRT observations were begun 82 minutes after the trigger. A faint, fading source was found within the BAT error circle. No candidate was detected by the UVOT in exposures begun 65 minutes after the trigger. Optical limits were m > 19.9 (unfiltered).

Observers using the ROTSE-IIIc telescope in Namibia reported a non detection in images begun 11.2 seconds after the GCN notice. Their limiting magnitude was 14.2 in a 5 second exposure (GCN 8228). Observers using the REM telescope on La Silla also failed to detect any afterglow candidate in 30 minutes of observations following the burst (GCN 8233).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift began observing this burst with the XRT 100 seconds after the trigger. The burst was double-peaked with a duration of 10 seconds. The XRT detected a fading, uncatalogued source. The UVOT failed to observe any optical candidate in exposures beginning 105 seconds after the trigger. 

Observers on the ground also attempted to catch an optical afterglow. Images taken using the GROND instrument found a faint candidate at z’ = 22.4.The same instrument did not find any candidate to r > 23.2, i’ > 23.0 initially (GCN 8218). However, subsequent analysis of the data turned up the source in other bands:

g > 23.3 +- 0.1
r > 23.3 +- 0.1
i > 23.0 +- 0.1
z = 22.52 +- 0.15
J = 20.90 +- 0.06
H = 20.67 +- 0.09
K = 20.54 +- 0.21

From these values they deduce a photometric redshift z = 6.44 +/- 0.3 (GCN 8223). Observations from the REM telescope (La Silla) taken at high air mass starting 6 minutes after the burst did not reveal any afterglow candidate (GCN 8220). Observations taken at the VLT detected a faint object at z = 23.1. Like the initial report from the GROND observers, those at VLT did not see the object in any other filters (GCN 8221). Spectroscopic observations at the VLT found a drop in the continuum which, if interpreted as the onset of the Lyman-alpha forest, suggest z = 6.7 (GCN 8225). At the time of this detection this burst holds the record for highest-z gamma ray burst.</grb_description>

The BAT detected a three-peaked light curve, each peak lasting approximately 10 seconds with a total event duration around 90 seconds. The XRT began observing 103 seconds after the BAT trigger and found a bright uncatalogued X-ray source. The UVOT began obersvations 112 seconds after the BAT trigger (GCN 8182), and found an afterglow candidate with a mag of ~19 v (GCN 8192).

The ESO VLT found "Spectroscopy of the afterglow reveals resonance absorption features from several ions, including OI, SiII, CIV, FeII, AlII, AlIII, MgII, MgI, at a redshift z = 2.374." (GCN 8191)

Observers from the ground also attempted to catch the afterglow. The ROTSE-III telescope began observing the field 7 seconds after the GCN notice. It found no optical counterpart to m=18.3 at 161 seconds after the burst (GCN 8170). Similar results were reported by observers at TAROT Calern (GCN 8171). However, observations made using the 1.5 m OSN telescope in Spain showed a possible optical transient at T+78 minutes with I~21 with 

R.A.: 05:47:10.08
Dec.: +51:15:50.9

A group at the Astrotel-Caucasus telescope reports a possible optical transient within the error circle in an exposure begun 358 seconds after the burst. The candidate has R~19.1. They lost the object in growing twilight after their second exposure (GCN 8173). Observers using the Liverpool telescope detected the candidate at i’=21.32 +/- 0.7 and 21.52 +/- 0.11 in exposures taken at 2.9 hr and 4.08 hr (GCN 8174). Observers at the Mt.

		<grb_description>This burst was detected by SuperAGILE. It had a duration of 25 seconds.  Followup observations with the XRT aboard Swift taken 11 hours after the burst showed a faint, uncatalogued source within the AGILE error circle (GCN 8157). Observations taken with the UVOT gave only upper limits (GCN 8161):

		<grb_description>SuperAGILE localized this burst. It had a duration of ~50 seconds and a multipeaked structure.  A possible optical counterpart was reported by observers using the Danish 1.54 m telescope on La Silla (GCN 8135). The object had a magnitude I = 17.4 +/- 0.2. In further observations, these same observers confirmed that the object was fading, and from it SED in UBVRI estimate a lower limit of z>3 for its redshift (GCN 8137). Observations made with the XRT aboard Swift also confirmed the reality of the source, and its fading (GCN 8140).

		<grb_description>This very long, very bright burst was detected by the Swift burst monitor. The satellite slewed immediately to the source and began observing with both the XRT and the UVOT at 75 and 100 seconds, respectively. Both instruments found a bright, fading source. 
In addition, many ground-based observers detected the bright afterglow, both in the seconds following the burst (GCN 8081 and 8084) and for several hours thereafter (GCN 8084, 8085, others). These all show that the source began around V~13 and faded to V~19 after ~5.5 hours (GCN 8085) and to V~20 after ~12 hours (GCN 8090). Many other observers had consistent results.
A tentative redshift based on a Lyman limit system assumed to be that of the host galaxy was obtained using Keck/HIRES: z = 3.35 (GCN 8083). </grb_description>

XRT observations started 78 seconds after the trigger, revealing a bright, variable, uncatalogued source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also observed the field, but initial unfiltered images lasting 86 seconds did not show an afterglow. The estimated limiting magnitude was 18.5. 

Imaging with the 0.5 meter telescope at the University of the Virgin Islands on St. Thomas did not show any afterglow. The images lasted 5 minutes and where taken in R-band starting about 9 hours after the burst. Limiting magnitude was 18.5 (GCN 8053).

Additional analysis of the UVOT data pushed the magnitude limit for the initial images to 20.0. Additional images taken subsequently, from about an hour post burst and continuing for about half an hour, also failed to detect any OC in five filters to comparable limits (GCN 8055)."</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was detected and localized by SuperAGILE. It occurred 22 degrees off-axis of the detector and had a duration of approximately 80 seconds in the 20-60 keV energy band. The burst had only a single peak. 

The UVOT aboard Swift began observing this field 5 hours after the AGILE trigger. It observed an optical afterglow in the White, V and B filters.  The observed magnitudes are as follows (GCN 7905):

White   18769   19567   799    20.3 +/- 0.1
White   24551   25179   1427   20.6 +/- 0.1

U       17880   23741   240    >20.4 (3-sigma UL)

Swift also detected the burst with  the XRT (GCN 7906).

From the ground a detection has been reported by observers on the OSN 1.5 meter telescope in Spain. They reported null results for their initial observations taken just over 8 hours after the burst (GCN 7904). However, subsequent observations undertaken 14.76 hours after the trigger showed an object at I=20.0. Reanalysis of the earlier observations also showed the object at I=19.3 (GCN 7907); the decay supports the claim that this is indeed the optical afterglow of the burst. </grb_description>

Ground-based observers fared no better. Upper limits were reported from NOT (GCN 7878), GROND (GCN 7879) and MITSuME (GCN 7886). The GROND limits were faintest and had the broadest wavelength coverage.:

		<grb_description>This burst was detected by INTEGRAL/IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data. It lasted approximately 30 seconds, and at peak the flux was 1.3 phot/cm^2/sec.

The 2m Falkes Telescope North was used to observe the field of this burst beginning 3.9 minutes after the trigger. It detected an uncatalogued, fading source with R~19. The source was also detected in B and i' (GCN 7872). Additional ground-based observations taken using GROND at La Silla were unable to detect any source to very faint limits in several bands (GCN 7880):

g' > 24.2,
r' > 23.9,
i' > 23.5,
z' > 23.4,
J > 22.3 and
H > 21.3.

GROND thus confirms the fading of the OC reported by the Faulkes group, indicating that this was indeed the GRB afterglow. In observations made with the UVOT aboard Swift beginning 6.7 hours after the burst, no object was detected to similarly faint limits (GCN 7881).

The Swift XRT began observing the INTEGRAL GRB field 24.2 ks (6.7 hours) after the trigger. It detected an x-ray source within the INTEGRAL error circle, and there was marginal evidence of fading (GCN 7882).  </grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to this burst and began observations with the XRT at T0+82 seconds and with the UVOT at T0+92 seconds. The XRT showed a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT found an m=19.7 source in its 100 second unfiltered finder chart exposure.

The ROTSE-III telescope at McDonald  observatory found a fading 14.8 magnitude source in an unfiltered image taken 22 seconds after the trigger (GCN 7846).  Super-LOTIS began observing the field 35 seconds after the trigger and detected a fading source with R=15.2 corresponding to the ROTSE-III source (GCN 7848). Additional ground-based observations also detected this source (GCN 7850, GCN 7856). Observations made from the RTT 1.5 m telescope 12.4 hours after the burst were not able to detect the OC (GCN 7861).

Spectroscopy of the object was obtained using the Keck/LRIS. In an observation begun 13 minutes after the trigger, the spectrum showed a strong damped Ly-alpha profile and metal lines from O I, Si II, C II, Si II* and others. The redshift determined from these features is z = 3.036 (GCN 7849). </grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to this burst upon detection. It began observations with the XRT after 90 seconds. It also observed with the UVOT. Both instruments were able to detect the GRB afterglow, but due to the proximity to a bright source, the magnitude of the optical candidate could not be immediately determined.

Observations from the TLS Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt Telescope were used to obtain images in Ic of the field. They also show a bright source not present in the DSS, but blended with a bright star. Presumably because of this blending, no magnitude information is available  (GCN 7830). Observers at the Liverpool Telescope report observations in R that yield an R=18.3 object 11.3 minutes after the trigger (GCN 7831)

The VLT on Paranal in Chile was used to obtain spectra of the afterglow candidate 1.7 hours after the trigger. At this time the OC had a magnitude R = 20.4. Due to the absence of Ly-alpha forest lines, the observers place a "firm upper limit" of z &lt; 2.1. Using absorption lines from Si II, C IV, Al II, Al III, Zn II, Fe II, Mg II and Mg I, they report a redshift of z = 1.6398 (GCN 7832).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed to this burst immediately upon detection. The XRT began observing the field 119 seconds after the trigger and found a bright, uncatalogued source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT also observed the field beginning 128 seconds after the trigger.  It detected an m=20.1 object in a 100 seconds finder chart exposure.

Observers from the ground were able to confirm the presence of the afterglow candidate. The Faulkes Telescope North was used to observe the GRB field starting 5:42 minutes after trhe burst.  It showed an R=20.12 object.  The Hobby-Eberly Telescope was used to obtain spectra of the object, and based on identification of absorption from Mg II (2796, 2803) and Mg I (2852) a redshift of z = 1.28 is inferred (GCN 7805).  Subsequent spectra were obtained using Gemini-North. These spectra showed the Mg II doublet mentioned above, but also Fe II(2882, 2586, 2600) and Mg I (2026, 2852). The redshift determined from these lines is z = 1.416, a discrepancy attributed to the possible errors in the spectral calibration files (GCN 7818). However, these results were later retracted (GCN 7819), as further analysis of the spectra showed that they lacked the signal to noise required to confidently make the aforementioned line identifications. Instead, an upper limit on the redshift of z &lt; 2.8 was reported. No additional spectroscopic observations of this source were reported. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to the location of this burst and began observations with the XRT and UVOT. The XRT began observing 102 seconds after the trigger. It found a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source withing the BAT error circle. The UVOT began observing the field 72 seconds after the burst and found a magnitude 15.9 (unfiltereed) object. 


On the ground, observers using the ROTSE-III telescope in Turkey began observing only 22.9 seconds after the trigger. They found an uncatalogued m=14.1 object (unfiltered) in the field (GCN 7792). Observing in R-band, a team at Super-LOTIS acquired images showing an R=19.3 object (in a set of 10 stacked 60 seconds images, GCN 7793). 

Additional ground-based images also showed this object. In general, very early exposures did not show the object, but then it brightened, seemed to plateau, and was then seen GCN 7795, GCN 7796, GCN 7798, GCN 7799).

A team using the NOT was able to obtain a spectrum, yielding a redshift of z = 2.69 (GCN 7797). This redshift was confirmed by observers at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (GCN 7815) </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This GRB hada a duration of 180 seconds and was detected by IBAS in IBIS/ISGRI data from the INTEGRAL satellite.

Ground-based observers at the Faulkes Telescope North reported an optical afterglow candidate with estimated magnitudes I=20.3 at T0+5.9 minutes and R=19.6 at T0+7.37 minutes (GCN 7788). These results were corroborated by observations from the KAIT at Lick Observatory, which found an uncatalogued object with I~18.7 approximately 10 minutes after the burst (GCN 7789).

Observers at Gemini-North were able to  obtain a spectrum of this object. Using strong lines of Mg II and Fe II they report a redshift of z=1.6880. They also note that in an exposure taken 107 minutes after the trigger the object still has R~19.7, showing that it has not faded much over that time (GCN 7791).

		<grb_description>Swift triggered on this source, but on-board processing revealed to be a source of too low significance to initiate a full trigger response. As a result, the source was not shown to be of interest until routine ground processing of failed triggers. Because the event did not cause a normal trigger response, the satellite did not slew to the field. It was only observed later as a Target of Opportunity. 
The duration of the burst was T90~9 seconds. 

In a 10 kilosecond exposure starting 36h 30m after the burst, the XRT aboard Swift found no new sources. Similar exposures with the UVOT begun at the same time yielded the same result. The lower limit on the magnitude for the UVOT is V=20.0 (GCN 7776).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to this burst and began observing with the XRT (T+86 seconds) and UVOT (T+110 seconds). The XRT found a bright, fading uncatalogued source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT was not able to detect any afterglow candidate in a 100 second unfiltered exposure;. Subsequent analysis of the UVOT images pushed the limiting magnitude to above 20.78 (unfiltered).

Using the FORS2 instrument, observers at the VLT were able to detect a faint object and procure a spectrum. However, they do not report any magnitude at this time, nor do they report any spectral features that allow them to determine a redshift (GCN 7770). However, in subsequent exposures carried out 4.5 days after the burst they report that the source had faded by 1.5 magnitudes in R, suggesting strongly that this is the GRB afterglow. The blue continuum argues for a redshift z &lt; 3, but without any features in the spectrum, no definite redshift determination can be made (GCN 7779).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The Swift BAT detected this burst and the satellite immediately to begin observing with the XRT and UVOT. The XRT observations began 99 seconds after the burst, and the telescope detected a bright uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT started its exposure at the same time, and found an object with m=19.8 in an unfiltered, 100 second finder chart image.

Working from the ground, observers using the GROND instrument at La Silla were able to detect the afterglow in g', r', i', z' and J as the object rose, with an altitude of approximately 20 degrees. Their estimate of the brightness is i'=21.38, just over 3 hours after the trigger (GCN 7756).

Observers at the VLT were able to use the FORS2 instrument to obtain spectra of the afterglow. At this time it had faded to R=23.0 (7.3 hours after the trigger). Their spectra show no Ly-alpha forest lines, implying that z &lt; 2.4. Using an emission line which they take to be [O II] 3727, they deduce are redshift of z = 1.545. Additional lines from Mg II (2796,2803) and Mg I (2852) support this conclusion (GCN 7757). From the same set of images they VLT observers report detection of a possible host galaxy for the burst. Both the images and spectra show contributions from this underlying galaxy (GCN 7771).</grb_description>

The XRT found a fading, uncatalogued source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT started an unfiltered 100 second finder chart exposure at 130 seconds after the trigger. This was followed by a 400 second V exposure beginning at T+236 seconds. Neither exposure showed any sign of an afterglow, with a limiting magnitude of 18.5.

Ground-based observers fared no better. A group using the 2 m Liverpool Telescope began observing the field 3 minutes after the trigger. They find only lower limits on the magnitudes: R > 19.6 at T+16.08 min, I > 19.2 at T+ 18.93 (GCN 7743).

Observations with the UVOT had begun at T+81 seconds. A 400 second finder chart image taken in V found no afterglow candidate to V~17.1 in this crowded field. 
Ground-based observers reported mixed results. A team from SMARTS collaboration on the 1.3 m telescope at CTIO reported no afterglow to I>21.6, J>19.5 1.2 hours after the burst. However, observers using GROND on the 2.2 m telescope at La Silla, Chile, reported a detection of an r’=23.92 object one hour after the burst. Subsequent observations taken nearly a day later did not show the object, suggesting strongly that this was indeed the GRB afterglow.

		<grb_description>SuperAGILE detected this burst. However, because of the location of the burst within the field of view of the detector, it was only able to give a very rough position in a long and narrow error box... 6 amin by 40 DEGREES. This very large error box was reduced quite a lot with the addition of data from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft in orbit around Mars, yielding a box of roughly 12 arcminutes on a side.

Ground-based observations of this field had mixed results. A set of observations from the Watcher telescope (0.4 m) in South Africa did not detect any source inside the error box to R~19 approximately 15 hours after the burst (GCN 7718). However, subsequent observations from the 80cm telescope at Izana Observatory in Spain showed a source with I~20.4 at a time 17.3 hours after the burst (GCN 7719). This latter set of observations was corroborated by observers using the GROND instrument on the 2.2 m MPI/ESO telescope on La Silla (Chile). They found a g'=19.95 object 21 hours after the burst (GCN 7722). These same observers reported a slow fading behavior over the subsequent 1.5 hours by 0.05 mag in i' (GCN 7724).

Meanwhile, the XRT aboard Swift was employed to image the field, and two sources were detected within the SuperAGILE/IPN error box. The Swift group reported that the brighter of these sources seemed to be fading (GCN 7723). 

The only estimate of the redshift for this burst was made using the XRT data (GCN 7730). They derive values of either z~0.9 or z~2.8, depending on details of the burst. See their Circular and references therein for details.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was locaized by SuperAGILE, but because the burst occurred while the spacecraft was witin the South Atlantic Anomaly, there was no prompt trigger. The burst had a duration of around 40 seconds in the 20-60 keV energy band.

An optical counterpart to this burst was reported by observers at Tautenburg, with Rc~22.1 approximately 37 hours after the burst. The observations were not able to determine if the source was fading (GCN 7701). Subsequent followup by Swift with UVOT suggested that it was not (GCN 7702). However, in later observations by the Tautenburg group (T+61.4 hours), the object was seen to have faded to Rc~22.69. 

A detection of this afterglow at the Keck telescope supported the non-fading behavior seen by UVOT. The Keck group reported R~22.2 at 1.31 days after the trigger, suggesting that this afterglow might have plateaued briefly before resuming its decay (GCN 7706).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to the position of this burst and began observations with the XRT 140 seconds after the trigger. It observed a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT began a finder chart exposure of 400 seconds starting 143 seconds after the trigger. A candidate afterglow was found with an approximate magnitude of 18.3. 

The afterglow of the burst was detected from the ground shortly after the trigger. Observers at using the KANATA telescope used the TRISPEC instrument to obtain an image of the Rc=17.5 afterglow only 220 seconds after the trigger. The burst faded to Rc=19.5 at T+5050 seconds (GCN 7686). Several other ground-based observers were able to confirm these results.

		<grb_description>This single-peaked burst had a duration of ~0.5 seconds. Swift slewed immediately to the burst and began observations with the XRT 75 seconds after the trigger. A fading, uncatalogued source was observed. The UVOT began observing the field 84 seconds after the trigger. The unfiltered images showed no afterglow candidate to m~20 (GCN 7665).

Observers at Keck (GCN 7666) initially reported detecting a possible, very faint afterglow candidate. However, subsequent observations from Gemini North called this into question (GCN 7667). Observations from MITSuME Akeno reported only upper limits on the brightness of the source at 5.4 minutes after the burst (GCN 7668).

However, unlike a typical short gamma ray burst, this one was observed to brighten after a delay of several hours. In follow-up observations to the previous ones, the original candidate object  did not fade, but a new object emerged nearby and also wihtin the BAT and XRT error circles (see image included). The authors exist that this is  an example of a never-before observed class of object called a "mini-supernova." See GCN 7678. This object is still being pondered.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a single-peaked, long burst, lasting ~20 seconds. The satellite slewed immediately to begin observations with the XRT (T+49 seconds) and UVOT (T+154 seconds). Both instruments detected candidate afterglows. The unfiltered magnitude from the UVOT was m~17.6 (GCN 7647).

Observations from the ground commenced from TAROT at the Calern Observatory  approximately 19 seconds after the trigger. They found a fading source with R~16 (GCN 7646). Additional observations from the ground were reported from several sites. Spectroscopy with a reshift were reported from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope of z = 0.767 (GCN 7654). 

The afterglow continued to be visible a day after the trigger, though it had faded appreciably (GCN 7681). An image obtained at early times obtained from AsU CAS Ondrejov in the Czech Republic is shown here (GCN 7651).</grb_description>

Starting at T+226 seconds the UVOT began a 100 second exposure, but no candidate afterglow was detected to a limiting magnitude of m = 20.38 (unfiltered, GCN 7639, 7642).

Observations from the ground were reported at Calar Alto Observatory in Spain using the 2.2m telescope. Observations begun approximately 7.5 hours after the trigger in BVRI do not show any afterglow candidate (GCN 7644).</grb_description>

The XRT began to observe the field 131 seconds after the trigger and found a fading uncatalogued x-ray source. The UVOT started acquiring data several seconds later and also found a candidate afterglow source with m = 16.5 (GCN 7598).

Ground-based observers also detected this source. Observers at La Silla used the GROND instrument to obtain NIR data of the field and reported detecting it in all bands. Observations begun 5 min after the trigger found an object with J = 16.5 (GCN 7599). The REM telescope at La Silla was used to detect an object with H~14.3 in data obtained 91 seconds after the trigger).

Starting nearly 50 minutes after the trigger, observers at  the VLT obtained spectral data from 3500-9000 Angstroms. They report detecting many absorption features, including those from Fe II, including the fine structure line at 2396, Mg II and Mg I, all at a redshift of z = 1.1 (GCN 7601).</grb_description>

The burst had a duration of 55 seconds, and showed a triple-peaked structure (GCN 7594).

The ROTSE-III telescope in Namibia responded to the burst and obtained images beginning 20 seconds after the trigger. It detected a source at m=12.8, which subsequently faded. There is no source on  the DSS at this position (GCN 7593).

Observers at the Calern observatory in France also obtained data starting at around 20 seconds after the trigger. They found a bright, fading source with R &lt; 12.5 in their first images (within ten minutes), fading to R ~ 15 in the next ten or fifteen minutes (GCN 7595).

Additional ground-based observations were reported for this burst from observers in Spain (GCN 7603) and South America (GCN 7597, 7599, 7600); all confirmed the initial reports above.

Spectroscopy of the burst was obtained at the VLT (GCN 7602). They detected many metal absorption lines with indicated a redshift of 2.433. These results were confirmed by observers at Gemini-South (GCN 7616). 

Observers at the VLA obtained data of the field at 8.46 GHz about a day and a half after the trigger. They did not detect any source (GCN 7614).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to this burst and started XRT observations 71 seconds after the trigger. A very bright x-ray source was found near the center of the field. However, due to issues with the telemetry, the prompt data was lost for this source. Also, no data were immediately available from the UVOT. Subsequent UVOT data showed a bright candidate, with m = 17.01 approximately 70 minutes after the trigger (GCN 7592).

Despite the sparse initial data from Swift, ground-based observers were able to observe the field and find the afterglow. The GROND telescope was able to begin observations approximately 2 hours after the trigger. They reported finding  a bright, new point source at the edge of the XRT error circle. The source was detected in all of the seven IR bands employed by GROND, with r'~16.5 (GCN 7586).

The VLT was used to obtain additional images and a spectrum approximately 2.4 hours after the trigger. They report R = 17.25. Their redshift is based on absorption features of Mg I, Fe II and other lines, and is z = 1.03, though they say that their wavelength calibration is based on "archival data." (GCN 7587).

Despite this observation being interrupted by the BAT detection of GRB 080409, the XRT still found an x-ray source in the field. The UVOT also observed the field, but no optical detection was reported. Limiting magnitudes were b > 19.96, u > 19.63, uvw1 > 19.97. All UVOT exposures were at time ~7 hours after the trigger.

Ground-based follow-up observations were performed from GROND using the multiband IR imager. In their first set of observations, begun approximately 5 hours after the trigger, they detected a source within the XRT error circle in all their filters.

		<grb_description>This burst had a duration of ~60 seconds. Swift slewed immediately after the trigger and began observations with the XRT approximately 70 seconds later. A fading, uncatalogued x-ray source was found. The UVOT also observed the field starting 82 seconds after the trigger. It found a candidate afterglow with m~18.8 (unfiltered).

Ground-based observers at the TAROT Calern observatory began observing the field 20 seconds after the burst trigger and found an uncatalogued object with R~16.8 at 300 seconds after the burst (GCN 7536). Observers at the ROTSE=III telescope at McDonald Observatory reported similar results (GCN 7538) as did observers at the Liverpool Telescope (GCN 7539). Observations in the IR were made with PARITEL (GCN 7542) and showed the afterglow in h=15.33, k=14.59 and j=16.00. Similar IR magnitudes were reported from GROND in observations begun approximately 3 minutes after the the trigger (GCN 7545).

A spectrum of the object was obtained using NOT and ALFOSC (GCN 7544). These observers report absorption from C IV, Zn II, Fe II and Mg II at redshift z=1.51. This redshift was confirmed using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, who reported the same lines as above, as well as some additional ones from Mg I and Ni II (GCN 7547).

		<grb_description>This burst had a duration of approximately 110 seconds, and a multi-peaked structure was evident in the gamma ray light curve. Swift slewed immediately to this burst and began acquiring data with the XRT after 99 seconds. The XRT showed a fading, uncatalogued x-ray source. The UVOT also observed the object, beginning 216 seconds after the trigger. It found an object with m~18 within the x-ray error circle (GCN 7525).

The burst was also observed by Suzaku in the 50 keV to 5MeV energy band. It showed the same multi-peaked structure and a total duration of ~100 seconds, as in the BAT data. The Suzaku data was fit using a single-index power law.

Observers from the Faulkes Telescope North detected the afterglow at R=16.96 at 167 seconds, fading to R=17.44 after 230 seconds (GCN 7526). A spectrum was attempted from the 6m BTA approximately 12 hours after the trigger. Though they apparently detected the object at R~22.5, their spectrum showed only a smooth continuum, with no emission or absorption features evident (GCN 7534).

From the ground, a NIR candidate was reported using the FLAMINGOS instrument on the Kitt Peak 2.1 meter telescope. Magnitudes for the object are J~18.76, fading to J~19.42 over approximately 40 minutes of observations (GCN 7515).</grb_description>

From the ground, Gemini North reported a fading source in i-band at i~22.9. They also report seeing this object in z-band, though not in r-band (rlim ~24  GCN 7488). Additional IR detections from the ground were reported from Kitt Peak using  the FLAMINGOS instrument, which found the object to have J~20 in 80 minutes of stacked  data (GCN 7491).

Other ground-based observers with smaller aperture telescopes reported only lower limits.</grb_description>

The UVOT began observations 152 seconds after trigger and showed evidence for a possible optical transient at m~19, unfiltered. Additional UVOT observations confirmed that the source was fading, and thus was the optical afterglow of the GRB (GCN 7458).

Observations taken by GROND just over 7 hours after the trigger showed the object in all bands except K (GCN 7503): g' = 21.3, r' = 20.7, i' = 19.9 and z' = 19.7.

		<grb_description>This is the third of four bursts for this date. The XRT began observing the field 224 seconds after the trigger and detected an uncatalogued source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT began observing the field three seconds later and found an optical candidate with m~18.8 (unfiltered). 

On the ground, observers at the KAIT (Lick Observatory) reported an optical candidate afterglow with R~17.4 (GCN 7441 and 7475). Super LOTIS observers reported the presence of this object as well, with R~16.8 (GCN 7443). RAPTOR observers reported the object as well, at similar magnitudes (GCN 7477).

This burst was also detected in the x-ray by Suzaku (GCN 7508) and by AGILE in the gamma ray, though it was outside the AGILE imaging window (GCN 7457).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This is the second of four bursts detected on this date. It is also the brightest object ever detected, having been observed to have a visual magnitude between m = 5 and 6 by PI of the Sky (GCN GCN 7439). But first things first...

The XRT aboard Swift began observing this object ~60 seconds after the trigger. If found a very bright, uncatalogued object which faded during the observations. The UVOT began observing the ojbect 175 seconds after the trigger and found that the object was so bright that it saturated the camera in the 400 second exposures. Subsequent ground observations from many, many observers reported magnitudes ranging from around R~12 to R~15 in the half hour following the trigger.

Observations taken in real time (like those of PI-of-the-Sky) were also reported by observers using the TORTORA wide-field camera mounted on the REM telescope at La Silla. They report a peak magnitude for the burst of around m~5 (GCN 7452). Similar observations by RAPTOR also reported an object with magnitude between 5 and 6 for this burst (GCN 7464).

Observations at the Westerbork Synthesis array and the Allen radio telescope both reported non-detections. Observers at the VLA reported detecting the afterglow at 4.86 GHz three days after the trigger (GCN 7506).

Such a bright object is interesting enough, but things got really interesting when spectroscopic results started coming in. Starting about 2 hours after the burst, Gemini South obtained a spectrum that disappointingly showed no features, thus allowing only upper limits for a possible redshift (GCN 7437). Then VLT reported a redshift (GCN 7444) based on the identification    of MgII lines: z=0.937! This redshift, along with additional absorption systems reported at z~0.7 and z~0.5 were confirmed by observations at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope using multiple metal absorption lines (GCN 7456). So, we have a 5th or 6th magnitude object (barely naked-eye) that is located more than half-way across the visible universe. This was certainly shaping up to be a record day.

		<grb_description>This was the first of four (!) bursts detected on this day... A record. 

The XRT could not slew to the burst position for nearly ten minutes because of Earth constraint. The observations it made showed an uncatalogued source within the BAT error box. The UVOT also observed the field and detected a faint, possible candidate (m~21.7, unfiltered).

Ground-based observations from Palomar Observatory confirmed a faint and fading source at R~20.25 approximately 150 seconds after the burst (GCN 7429). This object was confirmed by observers at Nordic Optical Telescope (GCN 7436).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift was able to slew immediately to this burst and began observations with both the XRT and UVOT approximately 90 seconds after the trigger. The XRT showed a bright, fading uncatalogued object in the BAT error box. The UVOT was able to detect an uncatalogued source at m=18.8 (unfiltered). 

Ground-based observers reported a possible afterglow candidate, starting  with KAIT at Lick Observatory, who reported a source at m~17 approximately 180 seconds after the trigger (GCN 7381). Many additional observers reported detecting this burst, with I~16, J~17 
 
Observers at the Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory obtained a spectrum of the object and reported a redshift of z=1.7 based on their interpretation of what they describe as a broad Ly-alpha line at ~3300A (GCN 7384).

Observers at Lick subsequently reported a redshift of z=2.4266 based on their identifications of SiIV, CIV and AlII 1670 - GCN 7388). These were then corroborated by the Megellan observers, who revised their redshift to 2.42 after reexamining their spectrum (GCN 7389).

Observations using the VLT Eschelle (GCN 7391) and Keck (GCN 7397) both confirmed this redshift (each finding two additional absorption systems at z=2.28 and 1.67).  

This afterglow decayed quite slowly and was still observable more than two days after the burst (GCN 7409, 7414, 7415).

Subsequent ground-based observations failed to confirm any optical candidate. Several observatories reported upper limits in the m=20 to 22 range. Gemini North reported a faint object in the IR at i=22.4 85 minutes after the trigger. This source was corroborated by the BOAO telescope in Korea, who reported a source at I=21.9+/-0.3 in observations begun at T+76 minutes.</grb_description>

Ground-based observations from the ROTSE-III Telescope in Siding Springs began observing the field only 8 seconds after the burst trigger. They reported no afterglow candidate but found limits between 13.3 and 16.2 for the first 11 minutes follwing the burst... they do not report which filters they used, if any (GCN 7349). 

The REM telescope at La Silla began observations 180 seconds after the trigger. They report an afterglow candidate at H~15.9 (GCN 7350).

Neither UVOT image showed an afterglow candidate, however, the XRT did detect a bright, uncatalogued x-ray source within the BAT error circle.

No afterglow was seen in ground-based observations begun only 30 seconds of the trigger using the ROTSE-III Telescope in Siding Springs (GCN 7336). However, observations begun 117 seconds after the trigger using the MITSuMe telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory did detect a faint, fading source with Ic ~ 17.1.

		<grb_description>The XRT began observing this field 106 seconds after the burst and found a fading x-ray source within the BAT error circle. In a 400 second exposure begun 109 seconds after the burst the UVOT failed to detect any source in V in the initial analysis.  However, subsequent reductions showed an afterglow candidate blended with a K star; these detection only were seen in the early exposures.

Initial reports from the ground reported the presence of a faint galaxy inside the BAT error circle. Later observers found that this was actually a K star (GCN 7304) and that the afterglow was blended with it. Observers at the MITSuME Telescope were able to estimate the brightness of the GRB afterglow by subrtracting the star (GCN 7305). They found it had g' ~19.5, Rc~17.8 and Ic~18.0 approximately 10 minutes after the burst. </grb_description>

The XRT found a bright, fading source within the BAT error circle. The UVOT found an afterglow candidate with v ~ 18.

The Katzman Automated Imaging Telescope (KAIT) at Lick Observatory began observing the field 64 seconds after the burst. Those observers report detection of a afterglow candidate at m = 17 in an exposure taken approximately six minutes after the burst (GCN 7251). Further of their observations showed that the afterglow at first brightened, and then dimmed sharply (GCN 7254). This behavior was similar to that observed by the UVOT (GCN 7253).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Earth constraint prohibited Swift from slewing promptly to this burst, so no immediate data were obtained with either the XRT or the UVOT. When observations were undertaken nearly an hour after the burst, the UVOT was not able to detect any afterglow candidate to m = 18.5 (unfiltered, GCN 7227). The XRT, however, did find a faint uncatalogued source withing the BAT error circle (GCN 7228).

Ground-based observations taken from the 2.2m MPI/ESO telescope (La Silla) using the GROND instrument did detect an uncatalogued source which seemed to fade over the period of the observations. They report detected the fading source in all bands of their detector (GCN 7231, 7232).

Observers at the Gemini South Telescope also report detecting the afterglow at R ~ 23 with no evidence of fading (GCN 7233).

No other ground observers have reported seeing the burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had two extremly short peaks, with a duration of less than a second. The first lasted no more than 64 milliseconds, the second was longer, at 256 milliseconds. The peaks were separated by only 0.3 seconds. These initial peaks were followed by an extended period of softer emission lasting nearly two minutes. This same structure was observed by Suzaku (GCN 7223).

Swift slewed immediately to the burst to begin observing with the UVOT (111 seconds), which did not find any source. The XRT (102 seconds) found a bright, fading source near the position of the burst. 

No ground observations have been reported for this source. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a sub-threshold burst with a duration of only 0.7 seconds. Because the burst was so weak, the satellite did not slew immediately to observe it. Only more than two days later, after the source had come out of Moon constraint, did the UVOT and XRT view the field. Not surprisingly, neither instrument detected an afterglow candidate.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This three-spiked burst had a duration of approximately 2 seconds. Swift was able to slew immediately to the target and began observing with the XRT and UVOT in under 90 seconds. The XRT detected an uncatalogued fading source; the UVOT was not able to detect any afterglow candidate to m=19.9 (unfiltered) and V=19.0.

Additional observations from the ground also failed to find an obvious afterglow candidate, at least initially. However, both Magellan and the VLT reported the presence of an edge-on spiral galaxy within the XRT error circle. They both obtained redshifts for this galaxy of z=0.384 based on emission lines from OII and OIII. Subsequent observations by the VLT enabled a faint afterglow to be seen after pre/post image subtraction of the field (December 28 and December 31).

		<grb_description>Swift was able to slew to this burst and begin observing with the XRT 130 seconds after the trigger. It detected an uncatalogued and fading x-ray source. No UVOT observations were made because the UVOT is still not recovered from the satellite's recent gyro downtime. The gamma ray detection showed this burst to be of unusually long duration, with T90=225 seconds.

No optical afterglow was reported for this burst. Upper limits above m~20 were reported from the Xinglong and Lulin and several other observatories. Detections in the NIR were reported by the VLT and Subaru. It was not clear at the time of this writing whether these sources were related to the GRB: the source was in z-band and barely at the detectability limit. Suggestions that this source was at very large redshift were made and seemed to be consistent with the data; possible redshift range was 5 to 10, but of course with such a faint source no spectra were measurable.  </grb_description>

The ROTSE-IIIb telescope of McDonald Observatory was able to obtain images of the source only 25 seconds after the trigger. They report a detection of an m=13.6 (unfiltered) fading source. They further report that comparison to SDSS data of this field show the source is close to a z=0.0166 galaxy with M_r=-19.4 and an old stellar population. However, subsequent redshift determination of the afterglow using the VLT give z=2.145, so it is far behind the Sloan galaxy.

Observations made by the TNT telescope at the Xinglong observatory more than ten hours after the trigger found that the afterglow had faded to R=21.4.</grb_description>

Observers at the Xinlong TNT report two possible optical counterparts, both with R~21.5. Later observations done by the SARA telescope reported that the first of these had brightened to R~20.5 and the second was either missing, or was actually an object seen in the DSS. 

To complicate matters, an uncatalogued x-ray source was detected by the XRT at a position different than wither of these reported optical candidates, though it was not seen to be fading; no optical source was observed coincident to the x-ray position. </grb_description>

Swift was not able to slew to the burst because of it's ongoing limited operation status. However, TAROT at La Silla was able to begin observing the position within about 2 minutes of the burst. They found a brightening object with R~15.6, which they later revised to R~17.0. Additional detections of the source were reported by Keck I and by PROMPT, which found I~17.5. 

Keck spectroscopy finds absorption features at z=0.98, which they claim are likely intrinsic to the burst. No IGM features are seen which could indicate a higher redshift. </grb_description>

Subsequent observations from Palomar and other observatories confirmed the presence of a fading object at the same position. Spectroscopic observations by Keck/HIRES failed to measure a redshift, but  give an upper limit of Z&lt;1 given the lack of any spectral features and detection of the object in U. 

Subsequent to the initial set of observations, the afterglow was reported to be brightening, and additional spectroscopy from Keck and VLT found multiple absorption lines. The redshifts reported ranged from z=0.9 to 1.1, with the lower values interpreted as absorption from intervening clouds, not from the burst itself, though it is possible that the higher-z absorbers were also intervening systems. No emission lines were observed, nor was there anything to indicate that the spectrum was evolving into a SN spectrum.</grb_description>

During this burst, the satellite slewed to a preplanned object. This maneuver caused the burst to leave the FOV of the burst detector at T+185 seconds. Therefore, there is no information about the behavior of the burst after this time.

Two extremely faint candidates were seen in the XRT during two observations made with 2.3 and 7.7 ksec exposures, respectively. One of the candidates was seen only in the second, longer exposure. No evidence for fading was observed in these sources. </grb_description>

A quite faint fading x-ray source was teased from 600 seconds of data following the burst. The source had a power law shape with spectral index 1.5 +/- 0.6. No source was detected in the UVOT.

Observations with the Las Campanas 40" telescope failed to detect a counterpart to R=21.8. Images were also taken in the IR using PANIC on the Megellan telescope. A six minute exposure failed to detect any point sources in the x-ray error circle, though a faint galaxy (Ks~18.2) was detected.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had a duration of 3.8 seconds, and Swift was able to slew immediately and begin taking data with the XRT and UVOT 69 seconds after the burst. The XRT found a fading source. Subsequent analysis of UVOT data taken several days after the burst also showed a faint and fading source inside the XRT error circle. However, the source was blended with an 18th magnitude star, which prevented accurate magnitudes to be determined.</grb_description>

Both detected the afterglow, with the UVOT showing an m = 16.8 object (unfiltered). Ground based observations using the Faulkes Telescope South did not find the object 5.5 hours later (GCN 6447). Observations from the VLT (GCN 6651) showed two faint sources close to the UVOT position. The VLT also obtained a spectrum of one of the objects, yielding z = 3.626. 
The afterglow was also detected by the Keck telescope approximately four hours after the trigger (GCN 6652).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift slewed immediately to this burst, which had a duration of 3 seconds. The XRT began observing 61 seconds after the trigger, finding a bright and fading uncatalogued object. The UVOT also observed the field, beginning 70 seconds after the trigger. No optical counterpart was seen in the immediate UVOT data. The limiting v magnitude was 19.6. 

Ground-based observations using the Liverpool Telescope reported the possible presence of an afterglow, but because of the rapidly approaching dawn the observations were stopped after only 15 minutes. It was not possible to determine if the object was fading (GCN 6621). 

Observers at the 10 meter William Herschel Telescope had better luck. They found an found an object with the same position as reported above, with R ~ 23.5. These observations were undertaken almost a full 24 hours after the trigger (GCN 6630). At around the same time, observations were made using the TNG/NIC, finding a faint afterglow with K ~21. No object was found in J to a magnitude of 20.7 (GCN 6635).  The object was also apparently detected by the Keck/LRIS at R = 25.5 more than four days after the trigger. There was no extended object seen, just the faint point source, so no sign of an underlying galaxy has been seen (GCN 6652). </grb_description>

Ground-based observers at La Silla report detection in the near IR of an afterglow, though observations were made difficult by the nearness of the burst to the setting sun.</grb_description>

The XRT detected a fading x-ray source, but the UVOT was not able to detect anything. The x-ray position is quite close to at bright star, making optical observations difficult.

The 6m BTA telescope in Russia reported a faint (R~22) afterglow quite close to the star, and subsequent reanalysis of the Swift UVOT data also indicate a fading source at this position. A finder chart from the BTA group can be found here:

		<grb_description>This was a long burst, with T90~370 seconds. Swift was not able to observe with the XRT/UVOT because of Sun constraints. However, several groups reported seeing optical afterglows shortly after the trigger. These data show that the afterglow was dimming by approximately two magnitudes (R) per day.

 The Suzaku x-ray satellite detected the burst (T90=35 seconds) and was able to obtain an x-ray spectrum. The Suzaku light curve can be found here:
http://www.astro.isas.ac.jp/suzaku/HXD-WAM/WAM-GRB/grb/trig/grb_table.html.

Five days after the trigger a spectrum of the afterglow was obtained by the Gemini North telescope. The spectrum indicates the redshift for the object is z=0.617. Given this distance, preliminary analysis shows that this burst is consistent with a supernova origin.</grb_description>

At that time, an afterglow was detected by both the XRT and the UVOT (UVW1 magnitude 19.1) aboard Swift.

The ROTSE-IIIc detected a faint, rising transient at the XRT position of Swift, with a peak magnitude of 18.4 (unfiltered) 36 minutes after the burst.

		<grb_description>This burst had a duration of 4.6 seconds according the the Swift BAT. Swift was not able to slew promptly the the position of the burst due to Earth position constraints. When Swift was able to observe the region of the burst 50 minutes had elapsed since detection of the burst. However, at that time the XRT did observe an x-ray transient, though one that did not show the fading typical for GRB afterglows.

Observers using the 1.3m telescope of Skinakas Observatory (University of Crete) were able to begin observing within the BAT error circle after only 57 seconds. They reported a faint transient with m=19.7+/-0.4 in white light. The object is seen in their first 10 second exposure, but is not seen in subsequent exposures.

Further observations from these same observers using their OPTIMA-Burst high time resolution detector show that the source is still barely detectable (2 sigma) out to 476 seconds, and that it showed several overlapping flares (7.6 sigma) until around 80 seconds past the initial GRB trigger, likely explaining the slow decay time observed by the Swift XRT.

Observers at the 1.5m OSN telescope (Grenada, Spain) reported a faint afterglow, R=21.5, 6.87 hours after the burst. </grb_description>

HOWEVER, a very faint possible host galaxy has been seen in Subaru observatory images (displayed here, from http://www.hp.phys.titech.ac.jp/nkawai/grb/070521/). It is unknown if this is the host or not, but the redshift of the galaxy appears to be z=0.553, a relatively recent 5.4 billion years ago.

		<grb_description>This was a long burst, with a single peak lasting about 95 seconds, though most of that was from a long, fading tail of emission. The X-ray afterglow flared many times, and faded extremely rapidly. 

Swift did not detect an optical afterglow, and no observatories got a confirmed sighting. The Subaru observatory reports a possible afterglow, but it is not statistically significant enough to claim it positively. The image displayed is from that observatory (http://www.hp.phys.titech.ac.jp/nkawai/grb/070520A/).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had a single, 15 second long peak of gamma-ray emission. The X-ray afterglow had some interesting behavior: it flared (got rapidly brighter) several times during the first 200 seconds, then faded steeply after the last flare. Then, 260 seconds later, the fading slowed. 

A fading optical afterglow was seen in all seven of the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope's filters. This indicates the GRB is relatively closeby, perhaps at a redshift no more than z = 0.7 (6.2 billion light years). If it were further away than that, gas between us and the GRB would absorb the ultraviolet light, and the UVOT would see nothing in its UV filters.

Several groundbased observatories report detecting the afterglow as well.

		<grb_description>GRB 070517 had a single, ten-second long peak of gamma-ray emission. There was a faint X-ray afterglow detected (the onboard software didn't see it and it was found by humans looking at the data). The X-ray afterglow exhibited several flares of emission as it faded.

The burst happens to lie very close to a bright (4th magnitude) star in the sky, so Swift's optical camera cannot view it. No optical afterglow has yet been reported by ground-based observatories either.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The bright burst was spotted by Konus Wind as part of the Interplanetary Network of gamma ray detecting satellites. It was also seen by the Mars Odyssey probe and by Swift, but it was outside the Swift Burst Alert Telescope field of view; gamma rays were detected but not enough to get a good fix on the burst.

Because of the way the IPN detects bursts, the exact location is unknown, so the coordinates listed above should be considered very tentative! They could be off by several degrees in declination , though only a few arcminutes in Right Ascension. The burst was detected by the Mercury probe MESSENGER, and when that data arrive better coordinates should be available.

The burst had a smooth pulse of emission lasting about 2 seconds, then a longer tail of about 10 seconds. Interestingly, this sits right on the cusp between long and short bursts. Usually, short bursts have higher energy gamma rays than long bursts, but this particular GRB also has intermediate energy! So classifying it will be difficult.

Using the energy distribution of the gamma rays, a redshift for the burst has been estimated to be z=1.39 +/- 0.2, corresponding to a lookback time of 9 billion years +/- 0.5 billion. Note that this technique only works if this burst belongs to the "long duration" class; see http://www.ast.obs-mip.fr/grb/pz for details.

		<grb_description>This was quite a burst!

The main emission of gamma rays lasted for about 50 seconds, and had about *20* bright peaks during the first 20 seconds. After that it faded, but emission was seen for about 800 second total, making this one of the longest bursts ever seen. The Japanese satellite Suzaku also detected the burst, as did the Konus-WIND experiment.

Swift's X-Ray Telescope saw a rapidly decaying X-ray afterglow, which was also showing flaring behavior -- rapid peaks of emission. The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope also detected an afterglow, and several observatories report detecting it as well.

One team of astronomers using the Danish 1.45 meter telescope in La Silla, Chile, report seeing the afterglow in red colors, but not bluer ones. Swift's UVOT confirms this, though the UVOT did detect the burst in visible wavelengths (yellow). This may indicate a large distance for the burst. We eagerly await followup observations! 

Update (May 9, 2007): Astronomers using the Very Large Telescope in Chile obtained a spectrum of the burst. Unfortunately, it was nearly featureless and therefore difficult to use to get the distance. They did see one emission line, but they could not identify it. If it is from hydrogen, the redshift would be z=0.033 (a distance of 440 million light years, which is very close for a GRB) and if it is from oxygen the redshift is z=0.82 (7 billion light years, which is more reasonable). However, neither distance is certain. However, they put a firm upper limit on the redshift of z=2.3 (10.8 billion light years) because the spectrum shows no trace of the "Lyman alpha forest", a series of absorption lines expected from very distant objects (see http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Lyman-alpha-forest.html for info on the Lyman alpha forest).

Update 2 (May 10, 2007): A pseudoredshift (http://cosmos.ast.obs-mip.fr/projet/) calculated using the spectrum of the gamma rays indicates a very rough redshift of about z=1, which is compatible with the estimate from the  VLT outlined in the first Update above.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 070506 emitted gamma rays for about 10 seconds, rising rather slowly and decaying somewhat more quickly. This was an "image trigger", meaning it was too faint a burst to trip Swift's main alarm (which looks for sharp peaks in gamma rays). Instead, Swift can detect a GRB as the gamma rays accumulate in its detector.

Swift also detected a fading X-ray afterglow which had several small flares. An optical afterglow was also detected by Swift.

The Very Large Telescope in Chile obtained a spectrum of the GRB, and found a redshift of z=2.31, corresponding to a lookback time of 10.8 billion years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a long, bright burst, lasting for about 120 seconds. It had two peaks of gamma-ray emission at T+2 and T+8 seconds. A bright, fading X-ray afterglow was seen; it faded rapidly at first, then slowed for about a half hour, then begin fading rapidly again. Konus-Wind also detected this burst and saw a very similar gamma-ray profile as did Swift. The plot of the gamma-ray emission displayed is from Konus Wind.

Numerous observatories include Swift report seeing an optical and near-IR afterglow. One report indicates that the afterglow may have brightened after 100 seconds (it was not seen in initial images and then seen in images at T+100). Interestingly, another observatory reports that the afterglow brightened by a magnitude (about a factor of 2.5) over the course of 40 minutes 4 hours after the burst.

A "pseudoredshift" (calculated using the energy of the burst and not the actual redshift) has been calculated as z=1.56 +/- 0.35, corresponding to a lookback time of 9.5 +/- 1/0.7 billion years. For more information on this method, see http://cosmos.ast.obs-mip.fr/projet/.</grb_description>

There were four separate peaks of emission: one at the trigger time, then three more at T=25, T+35, and T+60 seconds. The X-ray afterglow faded slowly, and like the higher-energy gamma rays underwent several flares of emission.  Suzaku, a Japanese X-ray satellite, also detected emission from this burst lasting for 75 second.

An optical afterglow has been confirmed, and like in the other energy bands has been showing unusual behavior; it appears to have faded steeply for about 5 hours, then stopped fading and became steady in brightness for at least another few hours.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This long burst had a very nearly symmetric peak of gamma ray emission, though there was a long tail that extended for about 160 seconds. A rapidly fading X-ray afterglow was detected by Swift.

Many observatories report detecting the optical afterglow. Several reports, in fact, state that early observations taken within about ten minutes of the Swift trigger show the afterglow to have brightened by 0.5 - 1 magnitudes (a factor of about 1.5 - 2.5) before fading; a relatively rare event to capture. 

Spectra taken using the monster Keck 10 meter telescope in Hawaii yielded a redshift for this burst of z=0.97, corresponding to the lookback time of 7.6 billion years. 

The image displayed was taken using the Very Large Telescope 3.7 days after the burst. The black rings are due to a very bright star to the lower left of the burst. This is a negative image, so brighter objects appear darker.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very long burst, with a duration of more than three minutes. It had two peaks of emission. The first peak brightened slowly, taking over a minute to get to maximum brightness. It faded after 105 seconds. The second peak reached its max 20 seconds later. A fading X-ray afterglow was detected by Swift, and many observatories report seeing the optical afterglow as well. 

A spectrum taken using the Very Large Telescope in Chile yielded a redshift for the burst of z = 2.954, or a lookback time of 11.4 billion years.

Update (April 20, 2007): The VLT also reports detecting the optical afterglow more than three days after the burst at a magnitude of R=24.22.

Update (April 23, 2007): the image of the afterglow is from the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, and shows the afterglow 3.3 days after the burst, when it was at a magnitude of r=23.95.</grb_description>

It is not clear if this is the host of the burst or not. The quasar has a redshift of z=0.703 corresponding to a distance of 6.3 billion light years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was seen by satellites participating in the Interplanetary Network: Konus-Wind, Suzaku-WAM, INTEGRAL SPI-ACS, Mars Odyssey, and RHESSI. This gives a rough estimate of the burst location, but it is not precise. The burst itself lasted about 12 seconds, but had a "hard" spectrum, meaning the gamma rays emitted were very high energy. That's usually associated with shorter bursts, so this may turn out to be a more interesting GRB than usual. 

Using the energies of the detected gamma rays, a group in France has estimated the redshift of the GRB to be z=3.36 +/- 1.0, corresponding to a lookback time of 11.7 billion years (+/- 0.9/0.5 billion years). See http://cosmos.ast.obs-mip.fr/projet/ for more info.</grb_description>

The optical afterglow is interesting. It was seen in the first Swift exposure, but not in any subsequent image, and no ground-based observatory saw it at all. It must have faded very rapidly.</grb_description>

There were several spikes or flares of brightness near the peak. The Konus-Wind satellite detected the burst as well. A slowly fading X-ray afterglow was seen, but no optical afterglow was seen by Swift (and no other observatories are reporting seeing any either). 

Using the gamma ray observations from the Konus-Wind satellite, some astronomers have estimated the redshift of the burst as z=2.75 +/- 0.95, corresponding to a lookback time of 11.3 billion years (+/- 0.6/1.3 billion years).

		<grb_description>GRB 070318 was a long burst, lasting over two minutes. It peaked rapidly in gamma rays, brightening over 12 seconds, then faded slowly. There may have been two more weak peaks of emission 140 and 170 seconds after the first peak, too.

A fading X-ray afterglow was detected by Swift. There was a weak flare of emission 200 seconds after the initial gamma-ray peak, and a very bright flare 80 seconds after that. 

There was a very bright optical afterglow. Swift detected the afterglow in all seven filters. 

Spectra taken using the Very Large Telescope, Magellan, and Gemini telescopes all confirm a redshift of approximately z=0.840, giving this GRB a lookback time of 7 billion years.

		<grb_description>INTEGRAL detected this 50-second-long GRB. Swift slewed to the burst and detected a fading X-ray afterglow, but saw no afterglow. 

However, ground-based telescopes with bigger mirrors (which can see fainter) did indeed spot the fading optical glow from the burst. The 60-cm REM telescope located at La Silla, Chile was on the burst in less than a minute and saw the glow in the near-infrared. This was confirmed by multiple observatories, including the 1.3 meter McGraw Hill telescope at the MDM observatory at Kitt Peak, images from which are displayed here. These images show the afterglow fading over the course of about an hour. The original images are at http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~jules/grb/070311/

Update (March 13, 2007) A third image taken by the MDM observatory shows the optical afterglow to be brightening! This is strong evidence that the underlying supernova event is starting to come through the GRB. We still have very few observations of GRBs with supernovae seen afterwards (see http://swift.sonoma.edu/resources/multimedia/newsletter/issue_4/index.html#high3 for example) so this is very exciting.

Update (March 15, 2007): The afterglow has been seen to be fading rapidly again, which indicates it probably is NOT from a supernova. Observations are continuing to determine the nature of the rebrightening.

Update (April 4, 2007): Astronomers using the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona report they still saw the afterglow 9 days after the burst, but the decline has slowed. It was at R=25.4 at the time. They also report seeing a faint galaxy 1.8 arcseconds away from the burst, and is probably the host galaxy. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>The European gamma-ray satellite INTEGRAL detected this 40-second-long burst. Swift was able to slew to the burst a little less than 4 hours after it was detected by INTEGRAL, and saw no optical afterglow. No ground-based observatories has made any reports as yet.

The Swift X-Ray Telescope did see a single faint source at the location of the GRB, but it's not yet known if this is the afterglow of the burts or not-- we'll have to wait to see if it fades over the next day or so.

Update (April 30, 3007): Swift re-observed the GRB, and the X-ray source seen earlier is now gone, indicating it was indeed the X-ray afterglow.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 070306A had three peaks of gamma-ray emissions. The burst that triggered Swift lasted just over a minute, and was followed by a much larger blast of gamma rays that peaked slowly and lasted for a total of 145 seconds. It turns out there was a small "precursor" peak of emission that lasted for 15 seconds and started a full two minutes before the emission that triggered Swift (but it wasn't bright enough to trigger Swift).

A decaying X-ray afterglow was seen, but Swift did not see an optical afterglow. However, ground-based telescopes do report an object at the rough position of the GRB on the sky. The object is very red, redder than a GRB or host galaxy generally would be. Followup observations indicated the object may have brightened, not faded. Because of these unusual properties more observations are needed.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this burst, but was in the middle of a slew (moving from one target to another), and the burst was at the very edge of the field of view. Because of that, Swift didn't automatically trigger on this GRB, but instead it was found when scientists on the ground were looking over the data.

Because the burst was seen just before it left Swift's field-of-view, very little is known about the gamma-ray emission, except that it appears to have had two peaks (a main peak 1 second after the burst began, and a weaker one 5 seconds later) and lasted for at least 8 seconds.

Swift returned to the burst 15 hours after the event and did see a faint X-ray source not known in previous catalogues, later determined to be the fading X-ray afterglow of the burst. 

No optical afterglow has been detected yet.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This 70-seconds-long burst had two overlapping peaks of gamma-ray emission. A bright but very rapidly fading X-ray afterglow was seen, which had dimmed to fainter than Swift's detection limit in just a few minutes. 

Several observatories report detecting a very faint source near the burst position in the sky, but intitially the object was not fading, and wasn't thought to be the afterglow of the burst. 

However, new observations with the Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary island of La Palma confirms that the object seen earlier is now fading! It may have been in what's called a "plateau" phase earlier, where the brightness is relatively constant. But it faded by a factor of more than 6 between the time of the burst and a little over two days later, according to the NOT observations. This indicates it really is the afterglow of the burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This long burst lasted about 3 minutes in gamma rays, peaking twice (35 and 55 seconds after the emissions was seen). A rapidly fading X-ray afterglow was seen. Swift's Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope did not detect any optical afterglow, and most observatories are reporting not seeing it either. One, however -- the 2-m Liverpool Telescope -- saw a very faint source at or near the GRB's position, but it's not certain yet if this is the afterglow from the burst or not (another observatory reports seeing nothing at this position, in fact). More observations are planned. 

UPDATE (March 23, 2007): Follow-up observations using the William  Herschel Telescope do not show any afterglow a few days later. However, the images taken went much deeper (could see fainter objects) than the images taken by the Livermore telescope. Since nothing was seen, that means the source detected using the Livermore telescope has faded, indicating it was the afterglow of the burst.</grb_description>

Using the information from Swift's gamma-ray detection, a team at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Toulouse et Tarbes in France have estimated the burst's redshift as z=2.15 /- 0.8, corresponding to a lookback time of 10.6 billion years.

Although Swift saw no optical afterglow, a confirmed Faulkes telescope afterglow has been detected by several ground-based observatories (with larger telescopes -- the RAPTOR-S telescope was on the burst in under 1 minute and saw the afterglow). The burst appeared near an extended source, presumably a galaxy -- possibly the host galaxy, though this is unclear. A spectrum of the burst gives a redshift of z=1.165, or a lookback time of 8.3 billion years.

The image displayed is from the 1.3 meter telescope at the MDM observatory in Kitt Peak, Arizona.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was detected by Konus Wind as part of the Interplanetary Network of satellites. It was the brightest burst ever seen by Konus Wind! It was also seen by INTEGRAL. Swift detected it, but was unfortunately entering the Earth's South Atlantic Anomaly at the time; this is a region of more intense radiation, maing observations uncertain at best. 

The pulse of energy detected by Konus Wind lasted only about 0.15 seconds, but had multiple peaks. A softer, weaker pulse of emission lasting 0.08 seconds occurred about 0.15 seconds after the first peak.

Update (Feb. 12, 2007): the location of this burst is not well determined, but the area in which it occurred includes the outer spiral arms of the M31, the Andromeda Galaxy-- the nearest large spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way (indeed, M31 is visible to the unaided eye!). If this burst came from M31, then the total energy emitted is on the same order as a magnetar flare. A magnetar is a neutron star with an incredibly powerful magnetic field, as much as a quadrillion (10^15) times as powerful as Earth's. In November 2005 just such an event may have been detected in another nearby spiral, M81. Because of the uniqueness of this event, followup observations are strongly encouraged!

UPDATE (February 20, 2007): The Mercury probe MESSENGER, currently on its way to the innermost planet, has a detector onboard sensitive to GRBs, and it detected this burst. using that data, the location of GRB 070201A has been narrowed down to about a degree from the core of the Andromeda Galaxy, an area of the sky which includes the spiral arms of the nearby galaxy. This brings strong circumstantial evidence to the table that this burst really may be a magnetar flare from the Andromeda Galaxy. Observations are ongoing.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was an exceedingly long burst! The main peak of gamma rays lasted for 580 seconds: nearly 10 minutes! Even then, there was an extended "tail" of emission that may have lasted another three minutes or so. The X-ray afterglow was seen to undergo several flares (rapid increases in brightness) for more than 11 minutes before settling down and simply fading. Oddly, Swift did not detect any optical or UV afterglow.

Update (Feb 7, 2007): Astronomers using the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma report the detection of an optical afterglow at R=21.3.

Images from the Very Large Telescope indicate an extended source very near the burst location on the sky, but it is not clear if this is the burst itself, the host galaxy, or an unrelated object.

The X-Ray Telescope on Swift did see a "light echo": X-rays reflected off of dust insides our own Galaxy. These typically form expanding rings are the light from the echo reaches Earth, and a partial ring was in fact seen. An analysis of the echo indicates that the dust lies about 300 parsecs (roughly 1000 light years) from the Earth, much much closer than the GRB itself.

		<grb_description>This was a very faint burst lasting for about one minute. It was an image trigger, meaning it wasn't bright enough to trip Swift's sensors, but over time enough gamma rays were detected to alert Swift's software that it was seeing a faint burst.

No optical or X-ray afterglow has been seen, but there is a faint extended source -- probably a galaxy -- at the burst's location. More observations of this odd burst are planned.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Mars Odyssey, Suzaku, INTEGRAL, and RHESSI detected this intense, 70-second-long burst as part of the Interplanetary Network of GRB spacecraft. Several satellites detected a long tail of emission lasting another 150 or so seconds. Swift slewed to this burst and was able to see a fading X-ray afterglow. 

Several observatories report seeing a relatively bright and slowly fading optical afterglow (including a radio afterglow from the Very Large Array in New Mexico). However, spectra (from two different instruments) reveal a spectrum of the GRB with no absorption or emission lines, which is highly unusual! Usually, for long bursts, there are telltale signs of hydrogen and oxygen, but for this one we have nothing (see below though). This implies the burst is very closeby, around a billion light years (that's close for a GRB). 

Update (February 7, 2006) Astronomers using the Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii report the detection of a very faint feature in the spectrum of the GRB indicating an "absorption system" at a redshift of z>1.547 (9.4 billion year lookback time). This means there is some object at that distance that is between us and the GRB, indicating the GRB is at least as far away. 

A potential host galaxy has been observed by the 1.3 meter PAIRITEL telescope in the infrared. The bright nature of this galaxy also implies a relatively small distance for this GRB. Observations will continue of this weird burst.</grb_description>

Konus-Wind may have detected an extended tail of emission lasting "several tens of seconds", but the data are weak. Swift was commanded to observe this burst one day after the event and thene again 5 days later, but no X-ray afterglow was detected.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had a very long peak in gamma rays: it took 3 seconds to reach its max, then faded away over the next 135 seconds. There were a few sub-peaks on top of the long decay of the main peak as well. The X-Ray Telescope detected a long fading afterglow with at least one small flare of emission, but some unusual behavior was also seen: after a steep drop, the X-ray afterglow actually brightened somewhat. Eventually it dropped again and flattened out. 

The optical afterglow was even weirder. It's fading at the same rate in all colors, which is unusual, and the fading is very slow. It was still detectable more than 55 hours later at V=21.6 which is *highly* unusual. It also shows none of the flaring of the X-ray afterglow.

Because of this odd behavior, GRB 070110A has been declared a "burst of interest" by the Swift group, which means they ask for any and all follow-up observations anyone can make.

Spectra taken with the Very Large Telescope in Chile give a redshift for this burst of z=2.352, or a lookback time of 10.8 billion years.

		<grb_description>Even for GRBs, this was a weird burst... especially from the start. Swift was executing a pre-planned maneuver, moving from one source to the next, when it caught this GRB already in progress. It only observed the last two peaks, both of which were quite long: about 112 seconds for the first and 90 seconds for the second. The gamma-ray emission was detected by the Japanese Suzaku satellite as well. It detected a total burst length of 92 seconds; this is shorter than Swift's detection possibly due to differences in sensitivty between the two spacecraft.

Swift's X-Ray Telescope caught two bright flares from the burst, one of which was coincident with one of the gamma-ray peaks. The UVOT saw a fading optical afterglow as well.</grb_description>

The second peak was much longer, weaker, and softer (lower energy). It lasted for about 90 seconds.

No afterglow has been reported. However, subsequent observations indicate the presence of an elliptical galaxy very near the GRB position.

It faded over the next 200 or more seconds.

X-rays were detected which peaked 140 seconds after the first small gamma-ray peak. No optical afterglow has been reported from any observatories, though many have looked.

		<grb_description>This was a short (less than 1 second long) "hard" burst, meaning the gamma rays from it were higher energy than from a "soft" burst. Swift detected a fading X-ray afterglow as well as an optical afterglow. The GRB was detected by Konus-Wind as well.

A faint galaxy was seen near the position of this burst on the sky, implying this is the host galaxy. There is also a cluster of galaxies seen in the same area, but the distance to that cluster is not yet known.

Update (December 20,2006): A team using the Magellan 6.5 meter telescope in Chile report that this burst lies very close in the sky to a cluster of galaxies called Abell 995. They measured the redshifts of the galaxy members, and found a redshift for the cluster of z=0.237, for a distance of about 2.8 billion light years, which -- if the burst was actually in a galaxy in this cluster -- is relatively closeby for a GRB. SEE UPDATE #3 BELOW!

Update 2 (December 21, 2006): A team using the Magellan telescope report that the nearest galaxy to the position of the GRB has a redshift of z=0.111, or a distance of 1.4 billion light years. This is significantly closer than the Abell 995 cluster. If the burst was inside that galaxy, it is fainter intrinsically than first thought.

Update 3 (January 5, 2007): Edo Berger for the Carnegie Institute reports that using the Magellan telescope, the average redshift for the galaxy cluster Abell 995 is z=0.0835, or a distance of 1.1 billion light years, much closer than previous measurements (earlier observations may have had some spectral features misidentified). Still, he notes there is a galaxy at redshift z=0.11 which is closer to the position of the GRB, and is more likely to be the host galaxy.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very long burst detected by Swift. It had four main overlapping peaks, with the last peak ending about 25 seconds after the first trigger, but low level emission was detected until about T+200 seconds. The RHESSI solar observing satellite also detected this burst, and also saw gamma-ray emission for about 25 seconds. A fading X-ray afterglow was also seen by Swift, as well as an optical counterpart.

The optical afterglow was quite bright, and has been seen by many observatories. In fact, the Los Alamos National Laboratory RAPTOR telescope took an image starting less than 21 seconds after the initial Swift trigger, while the gamma-ray emission was still going on! This is a fairly rare event, and the telescope did see the bright optical afterglow, which faded by two magnitudes (a factor of about 6 in brightness) in just 90 seconds. Images taken by the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope at La Palma (Canary Islands) show the GRB host galaxy starting to appear under the burst as the afterglow fades away. The image displayed is from that observatory (http://www.star.le.ac.uk/~er45/grb061126/wfc_r.jpg).

Swift scientists, using the optical color data from Swift, estimate that the burst is no farther than z=1.5, which is a distance of 9.3 billion light years. However, no spectra have been taken as yet to confirm or deny this.

Update added 12/13/06: This burst was also detected by INTEGRAL. Amazingly, INTEGRAL was pointed 90 degrees away from it, but the gamma rays penetrated the spacecraft and were picked up by the detectors!</grb_description>

Swift pointed to the burst a few hours after it was discovered, and detected a fading X-ray afterglow.

		<grb_description>This is a pretty interesting burst.

The initial burst of gamma rays detected by Swift was pretty bright, and lasted 10 seconds. But then, 40 seconds later, there was a much brighter blast of gamma rays which lasted for 150 seconds and had multiple flares of emission.

Swift had already turned its X-Ray and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescopes on the burst when the second flare went off, so we have a very rare set of observations during the actual event itself, and not of the afterglow from it.

The XRT saw a very bright X-ray source and a flare that occurred at the same time as the second gamma-ray flare. The UVOT detected the optical emission as well 167 seconds after the burst, which was bright enough (v=17.2) to be seen in small telescopes. ROTSE III, which was on the burst in less than 21 seconds, saw the optical emission at v=14.9.

The Keck 10-meter telescope was used to obtain spectra, and a redshift of z=1.314 was found for this GRB, corresponding to a lookback time of 8.8 billion years. 

Update (Nov 27, 2006): Reports are still coming in from this bright burst. It was detected by the Konus-Wind and RHESSI satellites as well as Swift. It was detected in the radio by the Very Large Array in the desert of New Mexico. The optical afterglow has been very well observed by telescopes across the globe. The image shown is from the MDM 2.4 meter (http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~jules/grb/061121/nov22.jpg).</grb_description>

Swift did not detect any visible emission from the burst, but the Lulin 1-m telescope at a Chinese observatory positively identified a fading optical afterglow. The Very Large Telescope in Chile was used to get a spectrum, and a redshift of z=0.757, corresponding to a lookback time of 6.6 billion years was found for the burst.

		<grb_description>This was a very long, weak burst. It lasted for 300 seconds or so, but was so weak it didn't immediately trigger Swift. It was detected in "imaging mode", meaning that instead of a sharp peak triggering Swift, the brightness was allowed to accumulate enough so that Swift noticed a burst was there.

The X-Ray Telescope detected a fading afterglow, but nothing was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope. No ground based telescope has reported seeing an afterglow either.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very faint burst-- if it was a burst at all. The event lasted for 170 seconds, but was very faint. The very low brightness may indicate it was not a GRB, but could be instead a lower-energy X-ray flash (generally, an explosion on the surface of an ultradense neutron star). Or, it might not even be real at all-- just a statistically insignificant fluctuation in the background gamma radiation of the sky. No X-ray afterglow was seen, which is very unusual for a long burst, and no optical afterglow was detected either. </grb_description>

UPDATE (Oct. 26, 2006): Swift observed the burst about 1.5 hours after the INTEGRAL trigger, and found a fading X-ray source, but no optical counterpart. Astronomers using the 8-meter Gemini South telescope report a source at i=22 (near infrared) but cannot confirm yet if it is fading or not, so they are not sure if it is from the burst or just some star or small galaxy.

UPDATE 2: The afterglow has been confirmed by astronomers using the ROTSE III telescope in Asutralia. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This bright burst peaked rapidly (~2 seconds) and then faded over the next 90 seconds. Interestingly, Konus-Wind also detected the burst, but saw it lasting for about 10 seconds. 

A bright, rapidly fading X-ray afterglow was seen, and a bright visible afterglow was detected as well. 

A spectrum taken 16.5 hours after the burst using the Very Large Telescope revealed no line emission from the burst, which is unusual-- these indicate the presence of hot gas in the host galaxy or the burst itself. The gas is certainly hot, but line emission can be weakened by a number of factors. The astronomers conclude this means the burst is at a maximum redshift of about 2, meaning it is closer to us than 10 billion light years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift saw two peaks of gamma-ray emission from this burst. The first lasted about 20 seconds, and the second was nearly 150 seconds later, rose quickly to a peak in about 4 seconds, and faded over the next 30 seconds. Unfortunately, the spacecraft had to move away from the burst position soon thereafter (from Swift's point of view, the position of the burst in the sky was too near the bright limb of the Earth, so Swift had to move away from the burst), so it's unknown if the burst had any more prompt emission after that second peak. 

Swift did see X-rays from the burst. Later in its orbit, when the Earth was no longer blocking the burst, Swift took another look and still saw X-rays; they lasted for about 3 hours.

An afterglow was seen in the infrared, and was in fact quite bright. Interestingly, the glow was very red. This could mean a lot of dust between us and the burst (dust makes the burst look redder in the same way that dust in the air makes sunsets redder). In fact, Swift detected a "light echo" from this burst-- a halo of X-rays around the burst as the flash was scattered by dust in our own Galaxy. This phenomenon has been seen before around bursts as well as other astronomical phenomena, and the burst was located in a part of the sky where there is known to be a lot of obscuring dust.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB061007A had a very interesting gamma-ray profile! There were at least four major peaks of emission. The first three were quite bright and had a lot of sub-peaks in them. They lasted for 20, 17, and 25 seconds with an 8 second peak between the first and second peaks (the second and third overlap slightly). A fourth, weaker, peak started about 80 seconds after the initial trigger as well, and faded very slowly, lasting about 820 seconds. The Suzaku satellite also detected this burst, with similar results.

A very bright X-ray afterglow was seen by Swift, in fact, one of the brightest seen since launch! 

An extremely bright optical afterglow was detected as well-- 195 seconds after the burst, the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on board Swift measured a visual magnitude of 12.8! This makes the afterglow of GRB061007A one of the brightest ever detected; it would have been easily seen through most backyard telescopes! 

ROTSE-II also saw the bright afterglow 26.4 seconds after the Swift trigger, at an unfiltered magnitude of 13.6 (the afterglow image displyaed is from ROTSE). Note that this is fainter than Swift's magnitude determination, even though ROTSE saw the burst before Swift did. This means the afterglow was caught while it was still getting brighter, which is *extremely* rare. This brightening has been confirmed by astronomers using the 2m Faulkes Telescope South in Australia. They determine the afterglow was *ten times brighter* 142 seconds after the burst, compared to 26 seconds after. By 400 seconds after the burst, the afterglow was seen to be fading by Swift.

Two teams of astronomers, one using the Magellan Clay telescope in Chile, and the other using the Very Large Telescope also in Chile, both found a redshift for this burst of 1.26. This corresponds to a lookback time of 8.7 billion years.

		<grb_description>Swift detected this short, intense burst, but it was seen by several other satellites as well. There were two very sharp and bright peaks, lasting about 0.5 seconds in total. Swift also detected persistent gamma-ray emission for an additional 130 seconds. A fading X-ray source was also detected.

Astronomers using the Very Large Telescope in Chile have confirmed the presence of an afterglow. They don't report the magnitude, just that source is "faint" and faded by a half-magnitude over the course of a day. It would be expected that the afterglow would fade more; however, the may be seeing light from the host galaxy mixed in. That makes the fading appear to happen more slowly.

The burst was a "short hard" burst -- "hard" means most of the energy was emitted as very high-energy gamma rays. Afterglows from these kinds of bursts are rare, so this is an excellent finding. They may even be able to determine a redshift. Stay tuned!</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Note: Swift detected a bright gamma-ray source a few hours before this burst, but this was a known gamma-ray source and not a burst. For a few days on this site, this transient (temporary) source was labeled GRB 061004A and the real burst was GRB 061004B. Since A was not a real burst, it has been removed from this site, and B has been relabeled as A. We hope this doesn't cause any confusion!

Swift detected this 8-second long burst, and also saw a fading X-ray afterglow. No optical afterglow has been detected.

Update (Nov. 2, 2006): It was originially reported here that a possible afterglow was detected, but follow-up obsrevations indicate it was not fading, and is therefore most likly a background galaxy. It's possible that this is the host galaxy for the burst, but there is not enough evidence either way. Here is the original report: "A possible very faint (red magnitude = 23) afterglow candidate was reported by astronomers using the 8-meter Very Large Telescope in Chile, but it has not yet been confirmed. The image displayed is from that telescope, and the candidate afterglow is marked by the two lines. The large black spike is an image artifact from a nearby bright star. It's possible, though uncomfirmed, that the galaxy to the upper right of the burst position is the host for the burst."</grb_description>

No visible-light afterglow was detected, but astronomers using the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo at La Palma report a near-infrared fading source, and the image displayed is from that telescope (http://www.iaa.es/~deugarte/GRBs/060930/grb060930.gif).

Update (October 9, 2006): the IR afterglow reported above has been retracted. The object detected is not fading with time, so it cannot be the GRB afterglow.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst lasted 14 seconds, and had a triangular peak of emission-- it rose up steadily and faded steadily. There was  a flare of gamma-ray emission lasting for 200 that started 400 seconds after the initial burst-- this is *really* unusual, and the cause is unknown. It may have been that some matter got gulped up the newly-formed black hole several minutes after it was born.

A very faint, fading X-ray afterglow was detected. However, there was a giant flare of X-rays that started 410 seconds after the burst, and lasted for nearly 13 minutes! This was at the same time as the gamma-ray flare noted above and is certainly related to it.

No visible afterglow has been detected, although several observatories observed this burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a *very* interesting burst. 

First off, it was found by satellites in the Interplanetary Network (IPN) which have gamma-ray detectors. The differing times at which the burst is seen by satellites widely separated in the solar system can be used to triangulate its position.

The burst was not in Swift's field of view when it went off. However, by sheer chance, Swift happened to slew through the position of the burst just 11 minutes after it occurred! Even more amazing is that Swift detected gamma rays from it-- this means the burst was still putting out high-energy emission much longer than most usually do. This has been seen only once before, with GRB 050904, which turned out to be an extremely distant burst. 

The burst had two peaks of emission. RHESSI, part of the IPN, saw the first peak to be 14 seconds length, and the second 25 seconds long, starting three minutes after the first peak-- again, very unusual to have two peaks so widely separated in time. Suzaku, a Japanese satellite, measured the bursts to last 14 and 70 seconds. Konus Wind also detected the burst, and the light curve displayed is from that satellite.

Swift also saw an X-ray afterglow. No visible-light observations were made since the GRB is located in the sky too close to a bright star.

A new and somewhat uncertain technique that uses the energy of the gamma rays to determine a distance found a "pseudo redshift for this burst of z=1.3, or a lookback time of about 8.8  billion years. Again, this is uncertain.

You can bet that observations of this really odd burst will continue, and updates can be found here as they come in.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 060927 had three peaks: two overlapping which lasted about 9 seconds, and a third that starts six seconds later and lasts for nine seconds. There was a faint, fading X-ray afterglow.

ROTSE-III in Australia got to the burst only 16.5 seconds after the Swift trigger (!) and saw a rapidly fading relatively bright afterglow. This shows how important it is to get on GRBs *quickly*-- the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on Swift started its observations just 51 seconds after the burst, and saw no afterglow down to a magnitude of 18. It had already faded too much in less than a minute.

Spectra taken with the Very Large Telescope in Chile indicate this GRB has a *very* high redshift: z=5.6, corresponding to a lookback time of a whopping 12.6 billion years! This means that the light we see from the burst left it 12.6 billion years ago, only 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang! While this is not a record, it is still a considerable distance and quite an achievement to get data on it.

There was a faint, fading X-ray afterglow which had a brief flare of emission 430 seconds after the initial burst. A faint optical afterglow was detected by Swift, which was later confirmed using ground-based observatories.

A redshift for the burst of z=3.21 was found, corresponding to a lookback time of 11.6 billion years.

Update (Dec 7, 2006): Astronomers using the Russian MASTER  robotic system (http://observ.pereplet.ru) report the detection of an optical flare in the GRB afterglow. It started about 400 seconds after the burst and lasted for about 300 seconds. The total increase in brightness was about a magnitude (a factor of about 2.5). An image of the light curve has been posted at http://observ.pereplet.ru/images/GRB060926/light_curve_new.jpg.

		<grb_description>This, the third of three bursts seen by Swift on September 23, was faint in gamma rays. It was an image trigger, which means it didn't get bright enough to trigger Swift; it was only seen as gamma rays built up in Swift's detectors. It had a single, very long peak lasting for 110 seconds. Interestingly, given that the burst was faint in gamma rays, it was actually bright in X-rays. 

A fading afterglow has been detected in the J (infrared) band using the Very Large (8 meter) Telescope in Chile. The image displayed is from that observation; the source labeled "B" is the afterglow. Object C is extended, so it may be the host galaxy of the burst. No afterglow was seen in the visible, so like GRB 060923A earlier today, this may be either a very distant burst, or embedded in dust, or both.

The gamma ray profile of the burst was long and smooth, which is usually more indicative of a high-redshift burst as well. We eagerly await spectroscopic observations of this GRB!</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was the first of *three* bursts on September 23. This had two solid peaks of gamma rays and a possible third one. The first was 6 seconds long. The second started about 39 seconds later, and was 26 seconds long (this was the emission that triggered Swift). The third possible peak overlaps the second one.

A fading X-ray afterglow was also seen. It actually brightened slowly for nearly an hour starting about 650 seconds after the initial burst, then faded again.

A fading afterglow has been confirmed by the Keck 10 meter telescope in Hawaii. It is *very* interesting that no visible light afterglow was seen; Keck detected it in the K band, which is infrared, but not in the I or J, which are not as far into the infrared. This means that the burst was either deeply embedded in dust (which reddens the light), or that this is a very high redshift burst (or both). No other follow up observations have been reported.

Update (Oct. 2 2006): a possible host galaxy has been detected using the Very large Telescope in Chile. It has an R (red) magnitude of 25.5 A galaxy this bright in the red is probably no farther away than a z=5 or so, indicating the burst is probably reddened by dust, and is not an extremely high-redshift burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB060912A was a bit of an oddball. It lasted for 5 seconds, which is on the short end of the distribution of long bursts. However, analysis of the gamma-ray spectrum shows that it's definitely in the long-burst class. For what it's worth, the Konus-Wind satellite saw it as well, and found it to last for 8 seconds.

A fading X-ray afterglow was detected by Swift, as well as an afterglow in visible and ultraviolet light.

A bright galaxy near the position of the burst was thought to be the host for the burst, but deeper and higher-resolution images taken using the Very Large Telescope in Chile reveal that the position of the burst sits right on top of a much fainter galaxy. This is more likely to be the host galaxy. The image of the afterglow displayed shows the position of the burst (green circle), the faint smudgy galaxy presumed to be the host, and the much brighter elliptical-shaped galaxy to the lower left that caused the initial confusion.

Update (9/26/2006): A spectrum of the faint host galaxy taken using the Very large Telescope in Chile yields a redshift of the galaxy of z=0.937, corresponding to a lookback time of 7.5 billion years. The spectrum is characteristic of lots of star formation in the galaxy, which is consistent with the long duration nature of the burst-- these are generally caused by young massive stars exploding. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 060908A is the fourth unusual burst in a row seen by Swift. This one had two main peaks. The first was actually made of three overlapping peaks blended together, and lasted about 18 seconds. The second peak started immediately after the first, and lasted about 8 seconds. 

Swift's X-Ray Telescope detected a fading X-ray afterglow which had a sudden flare of emission about 800 seconds after the initial burst. This may be due to the blast wave from the explosion hitting a cloud of gas near the burst, or a reflection of the X-rays from the blast itself off a gas cloud. The X-ray spectrum also indicates the presence of dust between us and the burst (more than what would be expected inside our own Galaxy). This is probably from dust in the host galaxy of the burst.

Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope observed the burst 80 seconds after the trigger, and detected a very bright afterglow-- it was at a V magnitude of 15.06 (+/- 0.03), meaning it was easily detectable in small telescopes. Several observatories report detecting the optical afterglow (though it appears Swift was on it before anyone else-- a relatively unusual event since many ground-based 'scopes can be on a GRB within a few seconds of the alert being received). The UVOT saw it in all filters, from ultraviolet to red, so we expect to have many more reports of observations from other telescopes as well.

Astronomers using the Gemini-North monster 8-meter telescope were able to get spectra of the burst, and found a redshift of z=2.43 +/- 0.05, which corresponds to a lookback time to the burst of 11 billion years.

Update (Oct. 2 2006): A possible host galaxy was detected by astronomers using the Nordic Optical Telescope on the island of La Palma. The galaxy has a magnitude of v=24.9.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Sometimes things work out in a funny way. 

GRB 060906A was detected by Swift when it was moving (slewing) between two GRBs targeted for follow-up observations. Swift triggered on the burst when it detected a rise in gamma rays from the GRB which rose to a maximum in about 4 seconds. However, when the data were analyzed by astronomers on the ground, they found that the burst actually started emitting gamma rays 50 seconds earlier, with a long, broad peak of emission that faded away after about 46 seconds. The second emission -- the one that actually tripped Swift's sensors-- started another four seconds after the first blast faded. Interestingly, the first peak was actually brighter, peaking at about twice the number of gamma rays per second as the second emission. But since it was so spread out in time, and Swift was moving between targets, it didn't trigger Swift. The second peak, which rose more rapidly, was the one that did the trick. Had the burst not flared a second time, it may not have been noticed!

A faint, rapidly fading source was seen in X-rays by Swift, and the Palomar 60" ground-based telescope detected a fading afterglow in the optical, with a red magnitude of 19. One observatory thought they had spotted an afterglow as well, but later determined it was a reflection off an airplane! This goes to show that you need a human looking at the data to make sure the automatic detectors don't make mistakes like that. 

The Very Large Telescope in Chile took a spectrum of the burst afterglow, and determined a redshift of z=3.685, which means the burst is seen about 12 billion  years ago.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst occurred just an hour and a half after GRB060904A. It had a Fast Rise/Exponential Decay profile (usually called "FRED"; meaning it got bright quickly and faded slowly), rising to a peak in about 5 seconds then fading for the next 47 seconds. There was a second peak two minutes after the one, which maxed out 30 seconds later, and faded away after about 100 seconds total.

The X-Ray Telescope on Swift saw a fading X-ray afterglow. There was a bright flare of X-rays that occurred 86 seconds after the initial burst that lasted for more than 400 seconds as well. Interesting, the X-ray spectrum (the distribution of energy of the X-rays) indicates that there was quite a bit of absorption by dust in this burst, more than would be accounted for by dust in our Milky Way Galaxy, indicating the burst itself was in a dusty environment-- and any clues about the burst are extremely valuable to figure out what kind of object exploded.

The ROTSE-III ground-based Australian telescope, triggered by Swift, was on the burst an astonishing 18.5 seconds after the initial explosion. It saw an afterglow at a magnitude of 17.3, and it was getting brighter -- usually GRB afterglows are seen to fade, so this is unusual indeed. The image displayed is from those observations, and a full-size version can be found at http://www.rotse.net/images/gsb228006_3c011-020_key.jpg.

Swift detected the optical afterglow as well, as did many other observatories. The French TAROT robotic telescope saw the burst 60 seconds after the trigger, and detected an infrared glow at magnitude 15.8, which is relatively bright. Reports indicate that the glow was seen to be fading after 7 minutes -- this indicates just how important it is to have extremely rapid response times!

Also, an infrared camera on a telescope in Chile detected the afterglow, which saw the afterglow being brighter in redder wavelengths, supporting the conjecture that there is a lot of dust between the burst and us.

The Very Large Telescope in Chile got a redshift for the burst of z = 0.703, or a lookback time of 6.3 billion years. This is relatively close for a burst, but still a long way off. 

No doubt more information will come in from this exciting burst (and from 060904A, another interesting burst)!</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a bright, interesting burst! Instead of a sharp peak or even a slow rise in gamma-ray emission as usually happens, this one gave off a weak amount of gamma rays for about a minute, with several small peaks before the main peak kicked in. The main burst of gamma rays took about 11 seconds to rise to a maximum, then faded over the next 70 seconds. The entire event in gamma rays lasted about 200 seconds. It was seen by the Konus-Wind and Suzaku satellites as well.

The X-Ray Telescope on Swift saw a very bright, fading source. No optical afterglow was seen by Swift down to V=20.11, even though it was on the burst in less than a minute after the initial detection. Due to a second GRB being detected just 1.5 hours later, Swift slewed away from GRB 060904A, so no data after that time was taken.

Using gamma-ray observations, a new (and as-yet unconfirmed) technique to determine redshifts for GRBs found a redshift of 1.84 ± 0.85, corresponding to a lookback time of 10 billion years for this burst.

		<grb_description>This was a bright burst detected by the INTEGRAL mission. Konus-Wind also detected the burst, and found it to have a major peak of emission lasting about 8 seconds, with a faint tail that lasted for an additional 7 seconds. 

Swift was able to slew to the burst and start taking data 3.8 hours after the initial burst, and detected a very faint and fading X-ray source.

No confirmed optical afterglow has been seen, though there are several candidate sources reported. 

[Update (March 12, 2007): reanalzying old data, astronomers have found what may be the optical afterglow from the burst. They have the details on their webpage: http://staff.science.uva.nl/~kwrsema/grb060901/.]

Using a new technique (that is still approximate at this time) that looks at the energies of the incoming gamma rays from the burst, a rough redshift of z=2.0 has been estimated. This corresponds to a lookback time of 10.3 billion years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very bright burst in gamma rays, and Swift detected it lasting well nearly three minutes and having four peaks of emission. Konus-Wind detected it as well, seeing gamma rays for nearly 200 seconds. The Japanese X-ray satellite Suzaku also reports clearly detecting the burst, seeing four peaks of X-ray emission spread out over about 125 seconds.

A fading X-ray afterglow was detected, though no optical counterpart was seen by Swift. No optical source was seen by the 8-meter Very Large Telescope an hour after the burst.

However, an infrared afterglow has been confirmed. It is fading slowly, which may mean that there is some contribution from the host galaxy as well. The galaxy itself gives off IR, so it makes it look as if the GRB is fading slowly. No doubt there will be more observations of this odd burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 060813 had an odd profile of gamma-ray emission. There was a 10-second-long burst of high-energy gamma rays (which rose quickly to a peak, stayed there for a few seconds, then faded rapidly), followed by a 20-second blast of lower-energy gamma-rays. The Konus-Wind satellite saw the same behavior from the burst. Suzaku, a Japanese/US X-ray satellite, also detected the burst, seeing a 6-second-long emission of X-rays.

A fading X-ray afterglow was seen by Swift, but no optical emission.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift found this burst to last about 80 seconds in gamma rays, with a slow rise lasting about 50 seconds. A faint, fading X-ray source was detected, but Swift saw no optical afterglow.
 
However, an optical afterglow has been confirmed using ground-based observatories -- the Nordic Optical Telescope, the Very Large Telescope, and the New Technology Telescope. The afterglow was very red, which may indicate the presence of interstellar dust between the GRB and Earth (dust absorbs and/or scatters blue light away, and lets red light through, so light coming through dust looks red to us). 

Update (Oct. 2 2006): An extended source was found weeks later at the position of the burst, and it is presumably the host galaxy. It is very red, which is consistent with the redness of the burst. The image of the host displayed is from the Nordic Optical Telescope on the island of La Palma (http://www.astro.ku.dk/~cthoene/GRBs/).</grb_description>

The X-Ray telescope detected a slowly fading X-ray afterglow, but no optical afterglow was seen by Swift. There have been some reports of a faint afterglow in the R (red), but these have not yet been confirmed.

Update (Aug 22, 2006): Spectra taken at the Gemini North observatory yield a redshift of z=1.131 to the host galaxy (based on a single emission line, so this is not rock-solid) corresponding to a lookback time of 8.3 billion years.

		<grb_description>GRB 060729 had multiple peaks of gamma-ray emission: the first two lasted for 12 and 6 seconds, respectively, and the later two overlapped significantly and lasted for over a minute. The total duration of the burst was 137 seconds.

The X-Ray Telescope detected a bright, fading counterpart. When the XRT began its observations, the burst was fading from a very bright flare, and another flare of X-rays started up 174 seconds after the burst. 

The optical behavior was odd as well. It was detected in all of Swift's UVOT filters. While the brightness stayed constant using the V (visual, roughly corresponding to yellow light) filter, the afterglow got *brighter* in the unfiltered images, meaning it brightened in some color that was not yellow. It's not known in what color it brightened. 

The ROTSE-IIIa telescope in Australia also saw odd behavior. The first image they took, a 5 second exposure which started about a minute after the burst, showed no afterglow down to  magnitude 16.6. Then just 23 seconds later, an afterglow at magnitude 15.7 was clearly detected. The afterglow brightened over several minutes, and faded very slowly. The ROTSEIII astronomers noted that this is one of the slowest average decays over two days they have seen with this telescope.

The Very Large Telescope in Chile obtained spectra, and determined a relatively low redshift of z=0.54 for this burst, corresponding to a lookback time of 5.3 billion years. Because of the odd behavior of the burst, how bright it got, and its relatively nearby location, it may be possible to detect the accompanying supernova emission (which is usually too faint to detect due to a typical GRB's distance). No doubt many observatories will be following up on this interesting and unusual burst.

Update (August 10, 2006): As of Aug. 8. the afterglow was still detectable by Swift in the UV, although not in the visible.

Update 2 (August 18, 2006): Astronomers using the 1.3m telescope at CTIO in South America report that they detected a very faint source at the GRB's position when they combined observations taken 13.6, 15.6 and 17.6 days after the burst. They observed in the near infrared (I band) and saw an object at I=21.9. It's unknown if this glow is from the GRB itself or its host galaxy. 

Update 3 (August 21, 2006): The GRB was observed by the orbiting XMM-Newton X-ray observatory. They saw the GRB fade with time, but there was a "large bump" of emission in the middle of their exposure from an X-ray flare of some kind. 

Update 4 (September 29, 2006): 61 days after the burst, X-rays are still detectable by Swift's XRT. This is the longest any GRB X-ray emission has been seen by Swift, and it is predicted to still be visible in December!</grb_description>

		<grb_description>If this was a burst, it was an unusual one. 

It had a single, smooth, long peak of gamma-ray emission lasting for 70 seconds. It was very weak-- Swift detected it using an "image trigger" (usually, a sharp peak of emission triggers Swift, but fainter bursts need to last long enough to "build up" an image in the detector).

There was no X-ray emission detected, nor any afterglow in ultraviolet, optical or infrared.

This is the first time that Swift promptly slewed to a long burst and did *not* detect X-ray emission.  </grb_description>

The second peak had a more symmetric rise and decay curve. Although no optical afterglow was detected by Swift, a fading X-ray glow was seen, and it had several flares (sudden brightening) as it faded.

A very faint near-infrared afterglow was detected using the Very Large Telescope (and was not seen by anyone else). It is shown in the accompanying image (it is Object #2) from the VLT (http://www.sissa.it/~malesani/GRB/060719/) along with other detected objects, and the region observed by Swift's X-Ray Telescope.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst lasted about three seconds, and had a "soft" spectrum-- the energy emitted was not from gamma rays, but more like high-energy X-rays (which have lower energy than gammas... still with me?). This means it is classed as a "long" burst, which tend to have lower energies, even though it didn't last very long.

A very faint, fading X-ray source was detected by Swift (only 56 photons were detected!), but no optical afterglow was detected by Swift or any other observatory so far.</grb_description>

A bright, fading X-ray source was seen, and a bright afterglow was also detected in the visible. The visible glow has been confirmed, and the image displayed is from the Shajn 2.6m telescope of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory.

		<grb_description>This burst had a single peak, which rose rapidly for about 3 seconds, then faded over the 8 seconds. A bright fading optical afterglow was clearly seen by Swift, and a fading X-ray afterglow was seen as well. From the brightness in various filters in Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, a redshift of z=1.8 is inferred (roughly 10 billion light years away), but this should be taken as a rough estimate.

A spectrum taken using the Magellan observatory showed no obvious features, but an analysis showed that the maximum distance to the redshift would be a z=2.3 (10.8 billion light years). A galaxy near the burst in the sky might be the host, and is at a redshift of 0.249 (2.9 billion light years). The image displayed is from the Magellan observatory.

Using the Very Large Telescope in Chile, a spectrum of the burst gave a redshift of z=3.43, or a lookback time of 11.8 billion years.

		<grb_description>This 102-second-long burst started off with a 6 second peak, then had several fainter peaks of emission as it faded away. It had a bright X-ray afterglow, and an optical afterglow was detected by Swift as well. The Konus-Wind satellite also detected the burst, with observations of gamma rays lasting for about 110 seconds, in close agreement with the observations by Swift.

As time goes on, this is proving to be an unusual burst-- even for a GRB! It was seen to brighten in the near-infrared wavelengths after the burst, and even after nearly a day, the afterglow was dimming only very slowly. There are some indications that the underlying supernova explosion of the star may be dominating the light we see now. In general, a GRB flashes and goes away, but a supernova goes on for weeks. In this case, as has been seen only a few times before, it looks like the supernova event may be coming to the fore. More observations may clear this up.

(Added June 19, 2006): And it gets weirder! Spectra taken with the Very Large Telescope in Chile showed that the spectrum of the GRB had no emission or absorption lines. These are features in the spectrum that are due to either gas and dust between us and the GRB, or hot gas inside the host galaxy, respectively. Not seeing either kind of feature is fairly unusual, and probably means the host galaxy is faint compared to the burst itself.

(Added June 20, 2006): Spectra taken with the 8-meter Gemini-South telescope reveal a single weak line of emission from the GRB. By itself, this was not enough to positively get a redshift for the burst, BUT, it matches a line seen in a galaxy near the burst's position. That galaxy has more lines in its spectrum, which allowed astronomers to nail down the redshift to z=0.125, which means it is at a lookback time of 1.58 billion years, making this a relatively nearby GRB. 

(Added June 21): This redshift has been confirmed using  the Very Large Telescope.

(Added June 29, 2006): the host galaxy has been identified in imaging, and is offset by 0.4 arcseconds compared to the position of the burst (by comparison, the Moon is 1800 arcseconds across in our sky). Given the calculated distance of the galaxy, this means the GRB was at least 2400 light years from the center of the galaxy. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>First things first: the position of this burst on the sky coincides with the direction to the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Looking in this direction is like living in the suburbs and facing downtown: you see a lot more stuff int hat direction, so it is very likely this burst was not a real GRB, but something weaker inside our Galaxy. The Burst Alert Telescope detection of this burst indicates the emission was relatively low-energy for a GRB, supporting the idea that this is likely to be a X-ray burst of some kind and not a true GRB.

Having said that, this event lasted about 13 seconds, rising quickly in gamma-ray emission, leveling off for a few seconds, and then fading rapidly. A faint X-ray source was detected.

There is a tremendous amount of gas and dust obscuring the center of the Milky Way, so not surprisingly no optical detections of the burst have been reported. However, infrared light can pierce that junk, and a faint detection has been reported by the BOOTES IR Observatory de Sierra Nevada in Spain. It had an R (red) magnitude of about 16.5 in observations 14.5 minutes after the GRB. This has not been confirmed as an afterglow, however. Also, a faint source was detected close to this location in older XMM-Newton X-ray observations, indicating once again this may be an object in our Galaxy which occasionally flares in X-rays.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Unfortunately, from Swift's viewpoint, this burst happened too close to the Moon in the sky for immediate followup (meaning no immediate observations were made by the X-Ray Telescope or the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on Swift). However, it's known that the burst emitted gamma rays for 70 seconds, and the peak was triangular in shape-- meaning it rose slowly to a peak and immediately started to fade slowly. Follow-up observations by Swift's XRT made about 2 days after the burst do show a faint, fading X-ray source.

The Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary Island of La Palma reports finding a faint source of light near the GRB position on the sky that is not seen in ground-based surveys done earlier, so this may be an optical afterglow at an R (red) magnitude of 22.5 -- the image displayed is form that telescope (http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb060602.897/). No other observatories have reported seeing an afterglow. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 060526A behaved a little oddly, even for a gamma-ray burst. It started off normally enough, with an 18-second-long burst of gamma-ray emission showing two separate peaks. Emission was also seen by the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. What's odd is that after the initial blast of gamma rays, the burst was quiet for about 200 seconds, and then suddenly started emitting gamma rays again! This second flare-up lasted about 50 seconds, and there was an X-ray flare at the same time as well.

The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on Swift caught an optical afterglow just 81 seconds after the burst. This has been confirmed, and The Watcher 40cm robotic telescope, located in South Africa, caught the burst 36.2 seconds after the Swift trigger. It saw the afterglow at a very bright 15th magnitude, well within the reach of amateur telescopes. 

The Magellan/Clay telescope obtained spectra, and found a redshift for this burst of z=3.21, corresponding to a lookback time of 11.6 billion years.

The image displayed is from the MDM 1.3 meter telescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona, and was taken about 11 hours after the burst.

		<grb_description>GRB060522A was a long, "soft" (meaning low-energy) burst. It had two peaks of gamma-ray emission. The first was 20 seconds long, and was a FRED (Fast Rise, Exponential Decay-- it got bright rapidly, then slowly faded), and the second rose rapidly in brightness, stayed at that brightness for about 55 seconds, then rapidly faded. 

The X-Ray Telescope onboard Swift saw a long, fading X-ray afterglow from this burst. It lasted for well over an hour, and had one small flaring of X-ray emission at 540 seconds after the initial trigger.

Completing the trifecta, Swift detected an optical afterglow about 2.5 minutes after the burst, which was confirmed by ground-based telescopes.

Using the monster 10-meter Keck infrared telescope, a redshift of z=5.11 has been found for this burst, corresponding to a lookback time of 12.5 billion years. This makes GRB060522A one of the most distant GRBs seen.

		<grb_description>GRB060516A lasted about 160 seconds, and had no obvious features in the gamma-ray profile. Such a long burst with no features may indicate it was at a large distance, though it will take follow-up observations to know for sure. Unfortunately, the burst's position on the sky was close to that of the Sun, so it is very unlikely any follow-ups will be made.</grb_description>

One observatory reported a possible detection of an optical afterglow, but it was at the limit of their capabilities, and no observations made since can confirm it.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had a single blast of gamma-rays, lasting for about 20 seconds. A fading X-ray afterglow was detected as well. The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope found an optical afterglow a mere 94 seconds after the burst-- it was quite bright as these things go, at a visual magnitude of 15.88. This was within reach of amateur-sized telescopes.

Very rough initial spectroscopy of the burst implies it is at a redshift of z=2.1, corresponding to a lookback time of 10.5 billion years. However, later observations made by the Keck telescope in Hawaii indicate a redshift of z = 0.4428, or a lookback time of 4.6 billion light years -- and this is very likely to be more accurate.

The image displayed is a near-infrared (J) image taken at the Nordic Optical telescope located on the Canary Island of La Palma (http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB060512/grb060512_NOT_J.jpg).

		<grb_description>This burst occurred just 38 minutes after GRB 060510A, the smallest time interval between two separate GRBs yet seen by Swift.

GRB 060510B was faint, seen by Swift in the "imaging" mode, meaning the gamma-ray light had to accumulate for Swift to detect it; it wasn't bright enough at any one moment to trigger Swift. This was a very long burst, with gamma-ray activity going on for at least 300 seconds. The brightest peak of emission actually occurred 140 and 290 seconds after the burst started!

The X-Ray Telescope detected an afterglow which faded extremely rapidly and had many flares-- sharp rising and fallin of X-ray emission-- going on for at least 880 seconds after the initial burst. It was also seen to be fading by the orbiting XMM-Newton X-ray observatory.

Nothing was seen by Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope. However, ground-based observations using the MDM 1.3 meter telescope in Arizona detected a fading optical afterglow which was subsequently confirmed by other observatories. A low-resolution spectrum was obtained which indicates the burst is at a redshift of z=4.9 which corresponds to a lookback time of 12.4 billion years.

The image displayed is the afterglow detected by the Gemini North 8-meter telescope, and is a total of 18 minutes of exposures in the J-band (infrared), starting 98 minutes after the burst.</grb_description>

It was seen to have an X-ray afterglow by Swift (the gamma-ray emission was also detected by the Konus-WIND satellite). An optical afterglow was detected as well by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope. Another GRB was detected just 40 minutes later (GRB 060510b) so follow-up by Swift was interrupted. No ground-based optical followup has yet been reported.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB060507 was a very long burst, with a duration of at least 200 seconds. There was an initial peak of gamma-ray emission followed by a long decay, with lots of slow spikes as it faded.
 
Could this be a *very* distant burst? Because the Universe is expanding, GRBs at great distances move away from us at high velocity. Because of relativity, this makes their clocks appear to "run slow", making them last longer. A short spike of emission also gets stretched out. Since this is a long burst with no short spikes (but lots of slower ones), this may be a high-redshift, very distant burst.

The X-Ray Telescope on Swift detected a fading source, but nothing was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope. 

A possible afterglow was detected by the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, a Canary Island. Images in the near infrared, taken about two days apart, clearly show an object in the earlier image that has faded by the time the second one was taken. The image displayed is a side-by-side comparison of the two images (from http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb060507.079/). The odd pattern in the background is called fringing, and is due to the way light behaves inside the detector, and is not real. The image on the left is smeared a bit because the GRB was low on the horizon, and was distorted by atmospheric effects. Clearly, the glow has faded over the two day time interval.

Hopefully, ground-based spectroscopy will be taken so that a distance to this burst can be determined.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Not all bursts are created equal. GRB 060505 was very faint, so faint that at first Swift didn't trigger on it. It was seen in "imaging mode", which allows the light from a burst to build up over time (instead of a sharp peak of light triggering it). When astronomers on the ground analyzed the data, they saw the very faint burst. It lasted about 4 seconds, and had a single, rounded peak of emission.

The X-Ray Telescope on Swift detected two very faint sources near the position of the burst. Swift re-observed the field on May 10, and saw that one of the sources had definitely faded while the other was still at the same X-ray brightness, so the first one has been IDed as the burst. 

The Gemini South 8 meter telescope has identified a fading source in the infrared at the position of the burst. There is also a faint galaxy in the field, which may be the host galaxy for the burst. The galaxy is at a redshift of z=0.089, corresponding to a lookback time of 1.15 billion years; this is relatively nearby (really!) for a burst. It is not known for sure if the burst was in this galaxy or not. 

However, the burst was observed by the Very Large Telescope in Chile-- they found that after the burst had faded, the position of the burst in the "host" galaxy was also where there is active star formation going on, which is expected if this burst was due to the explosion of a massive, short-lived star. So it's likely this galaxy was the host of the burst. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 060502B was a short burst, with (possibly) two peaks. The first is weak and unclear if it is real, but if it is it lasted 0.1 seconds. The second peak is stronger and definite, lasting 40 milliseconds (0.04 seconds). A fading X-ray afterglow was detected by Swift, but no afterglow. Also, a source of visible light was seen by some telescopes, but spectroscopy revealed it to be a normal star in our own Galaxy. It appears that no optical afterglow for the burst was seen.

Later observations of a galaxy near the burst location make it possible it is the host galaxy. The galaxy is at a redshift of z=0.287, or a distance of about 3.3 billion light years. It is not possible to be able to be sure if this is the host galaxy, however.</grb_description>

An optical afterglow was seen. Spectra were taken of the burst by two different observatories, but the distances determined are not consistent. One got a distance of 1.27 billion light years, and the other found it to be at 9.34 billion light years! Further observations should clear this up.

The afterglow image is from the 2.56 meter Nordic Optical Telescope on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands (http://star-www.herts.ac.uk/~palli/grb060502A/grb060502A.jpg).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this burst in what is called "imaging mode", which means the burst was not bright enough in gamma rays to trigger the telescope; it was only after enough gamma rays "built up" in the detector that it was seen (imagine a very slow leak in a tire: it's hard to detect the air leaking out at any given time, but after a while the tire goes flat).

A fading X-ray afterglow was detected. An optical afterglow has been detected by ground-based observatories at R=19.6 about 14 minutes after the burst. Deeper images show the afterglow sitting near a faint galaxy, which may be the host for the burst (although spectra taken later show features that are not very galaxy-like, so it may be that this is just some object that coincidentally appears in the sky near where the burst did). The displayed image is from the robotic MAGNUM telescope. </grb_description>

Unfortunately, the burst's position in the sky was near that of the Sun, and Swift could not slew over to observe it with its other telescopes, so this is all the information we have on it at the moment from Swift.

However, an optical afterglow was apparently detected using the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma. A fading source was seen in the near-infrared which has been identified as the afterglow of the burst. The image displayed shows that afterglow (the ripples -- called "fringes" -- in the image are an effect due to the way infrared light interacts with the camera, much like the way you can see ripples of colors in a soap bubble).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Was this really a burst? 

Swift detected multiply-peaked gamma-ray emission lasting about 25 seconds from this event. The X-Ray Telescope also saw a faint, fading source.

However, this burst -- if that's what it was -- came from the direction of a very large star-forming region in our own Milky Way Galaxy. This region, called the Cepheus OB3 association, is a cloud of gas and dust that is actively forming stars. High-mass stars are forming there, and it is not out of the question that processes going on in the cloud might form gamma rays without being a bona-fide gamma-ray burst.

However, extremely high-mass stars do form gamma-ray bursts -- could this have been a very nearby GRB? Almost certainly not! First, the burst was very weak, and the cloud is only about 2500 light years away. A burst, even an incredibly weak one, from that distance would appear to be be far brighter than the Sun. Also, a supernova (thought to be part of the GRB event) that close would flood the Earth with ghostly neutrino particles, and no such events have been reported from neutrino detectors (when a star blew up in 1987, it was an obvious neutrino event, and that star was 180,000 light years away, much farther than the Cepheus OB3 cloud!).

So what was it? It may be a genuine, very distant GRB that happened to be coming from the direction as the Cepheus cloud. The cloud is several degrees across, so statistically speaking that's not impossible. Or, it may have been something that happened in the cloud itself that we don't yet understand. More observations are of course needed. Unfortunately, the cloud is essentially opaque to optical light, so it is unlikely that any optical observations will be able to be made of this unusual event.

		<grb_description>This was a very bright burst detected by Swift (and seen by Konus-WIND as well). Lasting a little over two minutes, it had three overlapping peaks of gamma-ray emission. A bright, fading afterglow was also seen by the X-Ray Telescope on Swift, with many flares of emission as it faded-- the X-ray flares continued for about 6000 seconds after the burst, and the X-ray emission was detectable for 40,000 seconds -- about 11 hours. One X-ray flare corresponded in time with a gamma-ray peak as well, indicating that whatever is causing this is intrinsic to the burst itself, and not simply a reflection of the intense blast on surrounding gas clouds (it is essentially impossible to get a gas cloud to emit or reflect gamma rays). 

The optical afterglow was also detected by Swift. At a magnitude of v=15, it was easily within reach of amateur telescopes, and in fact at least two amateur astronomers have reported detecting it (Michael Koppelman of Starhouse Observatory (http://www.lolife.com/astronomy/starhouse/Home.html)
and Martin Nicholson of the International Consortium of Robotic Astronomical Researchers (http://www.icrar.org)).

A confirmed redshift of z=1.49 has been determined for this burst, corresponding to a lookback time of 9.3 billion years.

		<grb_description>Swift detected this 226-second-long burst which had two distinct peaks of gamma-ray emission, each lasting about 60 seconds, but separated in time by two minutes. Interestingly (but coincidentally) each peak had six smaller sub-peaks within it. The second peak had generally lower-energy gamma rays in it than the first peak. 

A fading X-ray afterglow was detected by the Swift X-Ray Telescope. 

The position of the burst in the sky was very near the Moon, making follow-up difficult. Only one observatory (the 0.8m IAC80 telescope at Observatorio del Teide in Canary Islands) reports a follow-up, and no afterglow was detected.</grb_description>

The X-Ray Telescope started observing the burst 173 seconds after the trigger, and saw the emission brighten for more than a minute before it started fading away.

Only one ground-based telescope reported a possible afterglow, a faint source near the GRB position. No other telescope has reported confirming it. It may be a star, the host galaxy, or the fading afterglow. At the moment it is not possible to tell.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this short, hard burst. There were many peaks of emission, perhaps as many as 20, each rising to a maximum and fading in about 5 - 15 milliseconds (0.005 to 0.015 seconds). The Konus-WIND satellite also detected this burst and reports similar behavior.

Swift's X-Ray Telescope detected a rapidly fading afterglow. It was also detected by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope. Analysis of the brightness of the burst at different colors implies it is closer than a redshift of z=1.7, corresponding to  a distance of 9.8 billion light years (the redshift affects different colors in different ways, which can be used to determine a very rough distance).

The afterglow image displayed is from the Danish 1.5 meter telescope at La Silla, Chile (http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb060313.008/).Observations using the Gemini South 10-meter telescope indicate a relatively slow fading of the optical afterglow, hinting that some of the light may be coming from the host galaxy of the burst.</grb_description>

NOTE: in this case, the coordinates given are NOT for the GRB position! The IPN could not nail down the GRB location in this case. The mathematics works out such that the position can only be narrowed down to a large ring or annulus in the sky. The coordinates represent the center of this ring, and the ring itself is 73.3 degrees in radius, which is admittedly pretty big. 

Due to the uncertainty of the position, it is extremely unlikely any followup observations will be made. However, Konus-WIND was able to determine that the burst lasted for 0.6 seconds, and was "hard"; that is, emitted high-energy gamma rays.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift could not immediately slew to this burst because the position of the burst on the sky was too close to the Moon. Later analysis showed the burst to have a single, bright, broad, 14-second long peak of gamma-ray emission, with many sub-peaks on top of it. There was low-level activity detected out to about 50 seconds from the initial burst.

The X-Ray Telescope was unable to observe the burst until 19 hours after the trigger, and found a faint source near the GRB position, but only detected 5 X-ray photons! This is impossible to distinguish from background noise, so it's not not clear if this was from the GRB or not. No detection was reported using any other telescopes.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This is a very unusual burst, perhaps the oddest yet seen!

Gamma-rays were detected from this burst for *2000 seconds*, an extremely long time. The burst was faint, with a flat emission (that is, constant brightness) of low-energy or "softer" gamma rays for 280 seconds. Around 200 seconds in it started getting brighter linearly, and at about 290 seconds it emitted higher-energy, "harder" gamma rays for 10 seconds. Eventually, it started to slowly fade away, with gamma rays still being detected 2000 seconds (over 30 minutes) after the initial detection.

Interestingly, Swift detected gamma rays from this same location over a month earlier, on January 17. Spectra taken of this event also show features similar to those seen in a supernova, when a massive star explodes. It seems likely that we are seeing a supernova-GRB connection, a rare event and one that is highly anticipated. 

The spectra reveal that this object has a redshift of z=0.0331, corresponding to a small lookback time (well, relatively) of only 450 million years; this burst was practically in our back yard. This is also indicative of a supernova, since a GRB this faint would be expected to be much farther away. In fact, some of the spectral features look like those from SN1998bw, another supernova-GRB event (see http://www.cosmos.swin.edu.au/entries/supernova-gammarayburstconnection/supernova-gammarayburstconnection.html) for more information). UPDATE (August 1, 2006): Using Keck, astronomers have confirmed a supernova nebula-like spectrum from this GRB, confirming the GRB-supernova connection. This is the most distant GRB ever seen with a nebular spectrum.

In X-rays, this burst had a long, slow rise in brightness, and faded slowly-- it lasted for at least 3000 seconds as seen by Swift. The orbiting XMM-Newton X-ray observatory observed this GRB for about 4 hours starting 62 hours after the initial burst, and clearly detected X-rays from it. In fact, there was no indication that the source was fading over the course of the observations, but this probably means the X-rays are only fading too slowly to be seen over the relatively short time of the XMM-Newton observations.

The optical light took 10 hours to reach a maximum as well; most GRBs are seen to be fading in optical light within seconds of the initial burst. Some astronomers thought it might be an unusual object in our own Milky Way Galaxy, but it is located far from where one would expect something like that to be, and the redshift confirms it is extragalactic. There is also a faint galaxy seen near the GRB position.

The supernova/burst has been seen in optical telescopes as small as 0.25 meters (10 inches), making this obtainable by amateur astronomers. It was also detected in radio waves, so this burst has now been studied across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

All in all, this is another very exciting burst, and more observations will be coming.

Update (July 25, 2006): after five months, the burst was observed in the near-infrared using the National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria) 2 meter telescope, and the afterglow was detected at I=19.53. It's unclear if this is actually the glow from the burst, or from the host galaxy.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was not detected by Swift initially; it was found by several other satellites which are part of the Interplanetary Network (IPN) of satellites which can be used to find the positions of GRBs. It was seen by Konus, INTEGRAL, Suzaku, and Mars Odyssey. The IPN satellites were able to determine that the burst lasted about 60 seconds, and was a FRED (Fast Rise and Exponential Decay, so it peak rapidly and faded slowly). Swift observed the burst and was able to nail down the position on the sky. 

It is unknown at this time if an afterglow was visible. A potential optical candidate was seen, but it was to fading, so it's likely to be a background star. A galaxy is seen near the GRB position, but it's unknown if it is the host galaxy. An X-ray source has been seen by Swift, but it is not fading. Sometimes GRBs don't fade much in X-rays at this time after the burst, so Swift will continue to observe this object to determine its characteristics.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had multiple gamma-ray emission peaks, lasting possibly as long as 120+ seconds. Much of the emission was weak, making the duration unclear. The X-Ray Telescope detected a fading source.

No optical afterglow was detected. Two very faint sources were detected near the position of the burst, but neither has been confirmed to be fading.

		<grb_description>Swift detected this burst, which had an unusual profile of gamma-ray emission. There was a spike in the number of gamma rays, which is what triggered Swift, but there was significant (but much fainter) emission for at least *230 seconds* before that. For fifteen seconds after the peak the emission declined, but then was followed by emission for another 200 seconds at least. In total, the burst lasted for more than 400 seconds, making this another extremely long burst.

The onboard X-Ray Telescope found a variable uncatalogued source at the position of the burst (including two strong flares of X-rays 200 and 385 seconds after the initial burst), but nothing was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope.

A fading afterglow has been reported by several observatories (though just below the faintness limit of Swift's UVOT, explaining the non-detection). The Gemini North telescope was able to get a spectrum, and found the burst to be at a redshift of z=3.91, corresponding to a lookback time of a hair over 12 billion years. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This distant burst lasted about 8 seconds (in fact, that is at low energy gamma rays; at higher energies the burst was shorter, emitting high-energy light for only about 4 seconds).

The redshift measured (and later confirmed by another observatory) was z=4.045, corresponding to a lookback time of 12.2 billion years, making this a relatively distant burst. Despite its great distance, a bright optical afterglow was detected by Swift at v=16.7 about a minute after the initial burst. Many observatories report that after an initial fading, the afterglow rebrightened somewhat, perhaps due to the flash of light illuminating clouds of gas and dust near the burst. This occurred between 2000-5000 seconds after the initial burst according to observations using the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical telescope. By 19 hours later, the afterglow had faded from Swift's view. 

The image of the afterglow that is displayed here is from the robotic 0.76-m Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>At first it was thought that this was an unusual faint burst, but on further observations it appears to be some other source of gamma rays. It was still seen emitting gamma rays a full day after the initial trigger, making it unlikely in the extreme that this is a gamma ray burst. Below is the original report written for this site when it was still thought to be a burst:

"This was a very unusual faint burst, lasting for 64 seconds. Swift slewed quickly to the burst, but the X-Ray Telescope did not detect any X-ray sources. This is the very first time Swift slewed to a long burst in under 300 seconds and still did not see an X-ray counterpart. The image displayed is potentially the host galaxy of the burst, reported by astronomers at the Terskol observatory in Russia."

More likely, the source seen at Terskol is the object itself, probably a faint neutron star that periodically gives off X-ray flares.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This odd burst had a very long emission of gamma rays. There was a strong peak, which started slowly about 30 seconds before it peaked, then slowly fell off in brightness for 30 seconds. There was some weak emission up until two minutes after the main peak, and a weak peak at that point. Interestingly, there is a possible blip of gamma-ray emission 165 seconds before the main peak, lasting for about 20 seconds.

The X-ray emission showed a lot of flaring, so much that it is difficult to see how rapidly the burst was fading! A fading optical afterglow has been confirmed (the image shown is from http://www.dsri.dk/~jgu/grb060204B/FCs/grb060204B.NOT.R.gif).

Spectra have not been obtained, but using other, less definite techniques, a redshift for this burst has been estimated as z = 3.1 +/- 1.1, corresponding to a distance range of 10.3 - 12.2 billion light years. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>INTEGRAL detected this event, see it last for about 70 seconds. It has since been determined that this is *not* a GRB, but instead some sort of transient flare from an energetic object like a magnetic neutron star. 

Swift detected this event with both the X-Ray and Ultraviolet/Optical telescopes. The optical source was variable, but the X-ray source was steady, again indicating this is not a gamma-ray burst.

Moreover, Jules Halpern at Columbia University points out that the old X-ray satellite ROSAT observed an X-ray source at that position as well, indicating this is most likely a Galactic (meaning nearby) source, and not a GRB.

		<grb_description>This was a faint, long burst. Swift detected it in "imaging mode"; usually GRBs are bright enough to trigger Swift, but this was faint, so Swift detected it by building up light like a camera taking a time exposure. The burst shows two long, broad peaks of emission. The first lasted 80 seconds, and the second (which started 30 seconds after the first ended) lasted about 140 seconds. 

The X-Ray Telescope detected a bright fading source. Nothing was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, but some ground-based observatories are reporting a possible afterglow detection. Using the monster Keck 10-meter telescope, astronomers initially reported detecting a faint source, but later observations showed it was not fading, so it is not the afterglow of the GRB.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This very bright burst was initially reported as lasting for 30 seconds, but later analysis of Swift data shows significant gamma-ray activity as much as 700 seconds after the initial burst! This makes it one of the longest bursts on record, coincidentally just one day after another extremely long burst was found (GRB 060123). 

Swift's X-Ray Telescope also detected the burst. It had an unusual X-ray light curve; it was initially flat in brightness then showed several flares of brightness after about 100 seconds. This may be due to clumps of gas or dust a few million kilometers away from the burst reflecting its initial brightness (essentially, an echo of light bouncing off of material near the burst).

An optical afterglow was detected with the 1.34 meter Tautenberg telescope, and confirmed by the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope and later by several observatories (the image shown is from the Xinglong observatory in China; http://cosmic.riken.jp/grb/eafon/GRB060124_Xinglong_Iband.jpg). Spectra taken at the monster 10-meter Keck telescope indicate a redshift of this burst of 2.296, corresponding to a lookback time of 10.7 billion years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very unusual and potentially very exciting burst.

It was extremely faint, so faint that it did not trigger Swift. It was discovered by adding up all the gamma rays over time in what scientists call "imaging mode". The duration of the burst was an incredible 900 seconds (+/- 100 seconds uncertainty due to its faintness). 

The longest GRBs last for 100 - 120 seconds, so this strongly implies (but does *not* mean) that this is an incredibly distant burst. Because the Universe is expanding, more distant objects are moving away from Earth faster. This burst may be so far away that Einstein's relativity comes into play in a major way, slowing the burst's "clock" relative to ours, stretching out the length of the burst in time. Given the duration of the burst, it may be at a redshift of z = 7 or 8, corresponding to a distance of over 13 billion light years. If so, this smashes any previous GRB distance record, making this far and away the most distant burst ever detected.

Unfortunately, the delay in its discovery together with its faintness will make follow-up difficult or impossible (though it was detected nearly a day later using Swift's X-Ray Telescope, which saw a faint, fading source). Spectra of the possible host galaxy of this burst, made using the giant Gemini 8-meter telescope, indicate a possible redshift of z=1.1, for a distance of 8.1 billion light years. This is still tentative, unfortunately. 

Even if this GRB turns out not to be at a large distance, it is still very odd and interesting.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>HETE-2 detected this short burst, which lasted about 2 seconds. The gamma-ray spectrum seen was "hard", meaning it was mostly very high-energy gamma rays, which is typical for a short burst. The burst was also detected by the Konus-Wind satellite.

Swift slewed to the target area, and the X-Ray Telescope reports seeing a fading source (those observations started 3 hours after the burst). 

Astronomers using the Italian TNG telescope in the Canary Islands reported a possible optical afterglow, and it has been confirmed by astronomers using the Nordic Optical Telescope also at the Canary Islands. Neither team report an actual magnitude; they simply label the afterglow as "faint". Other observations indicate it was no brighter than r=22. Astronomers using the ARC 3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory report a fading afterglow detection in near infrared (k-band) at a magnitude of 20. Hubble Space Telescope observed this burst approximately 6 days after the event, and saw no afterglow down to a red R magnitude of 28, which is perhaps the most stringent upper limit ever found for a GRB.

Some astronomers have reported that the burst appears to be very close to a cluster of galaxies, and a chance alignment has a probability of only about %5. That's persuasive, but not conclusive, that the burst came from a galaxy in that cluster. Two galaxies in that cluster have redshifts of 0.154, indicating a distance to the cluster of 1.9 billion light years.

No optical afterglow has yet been reported.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very bright burst lasting over 100 seconds. The main emission lasted about 18 seconds, but fainter gamma-ray emission was seen for well over a minute longer. Unfortunately, the burst's position in the sky is close to the Sun, and Swift could not follow up on the observations. The Konus-Wind and Suzaku satellites also detected this burst.

Ground-based telescopes were able to get some observations, and a *very* bright optical afterglow was detected by the Pierre Auger observatory in Malargue, Argentina. At v=11.5, this would have easily been visible in small telescopes.

There is also a bright galaxy very close to the position of the burst, and the redshift of this galaxy is z=0.042, indicating a distance of 562 million light years. That is actually very close for a GRB, which is consistent with the GRB brightness. However, estimates of the redshift of the GRB using other methods have yielded inconsistent results, with values ranging from z=0.45 (4.6 billion light years) to z=1.3 (8.8 billion light years). Hopefully follow-up observations will clear up this issue.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very long burst, with some faint gamma-ray emission starting as much as 60 seconds before the main peak, and fading away 70 seconds after the peak. A very faint X-ray afterglow was detected by Swift as well.

Astronomers using the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT) have detected a very faint, very red afterglow in the infrared (J band), which had faded away when follow-up observations were made using the Very Large Telescope in Chile. The VLT observations show a faint, very red object near this position which may be the host galaxy. This all indicates GRB 060116A is a very distant burst (although dust in the host galaxy would also make it appear red). Hopefully spectra will be taken soon so a distance can be determined.   Examination of observations using the Very Large Telescope indicate a photometric redshift (that is, a redshift found using the colors of the afterglow) of 6.6, corresponding to a lookback time of 12.83 billion light years. If true, this is the most distant burst ever seen, but the redshift is still very tentative. 

The afterglow was also detected weakly in radio wavelengths using the Very Large Array in new Mexico.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this long burst. Its gamma-ray emission was a bit more complex than originally thought. There was a faint peak that started about 50 seconds before the actual event that triggered the GRB detection by Swift. It peaked about T -30 seconds, then merged into a second peak which was the actual event that triggered Swift. That one lasted about 50 seconds, rising and fading at about the same rate. The third peak started at T +80 seconds, peaked 15 seconds later, and faded for another 25 seconds.

The X-Ray Telescope detected a fading X-ray source at that location, though no source as seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope.

However, the Japanese MITSuME 50 cm telescope at Okayama detected a fading afterglow in the near infrared 6 minutes after the initial burst. It was detected in R (red) and I (near infrared), and was brighter in I than R (meaning it is a very red object). This is very interesting-- the smooth (and unusual) gamma-ray light curve may indicate a distant burst, and having a detection in infrared but not visible light is also consistent with this burst being very far away. 

Update: A spectrum of the afterglow obtained by the Very Large Telescope in Chile 13 hours after the burst indicates a redshift of the burst of 3.53, corresponding to a lookback time of 11.9 billion years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The second GRB detected on January 11, 2006, had two peaks of gamma-ray emission. The first peak lasted for about 32 seconds, with a relatively symmetric rise and fall of gamma rays. The second started 15 seconds later and lasted for 9 seconds. The X-Ray Telescope on Swift detected a fading afterglow-- the Japanese Suzaku satellite also detected X-ray emission from the burst. The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope caught the afterglow in an exposure that started just 84 seconds after the burst, and saw the glow at a visual magnitude of 17.2.

Interestingly, the ROTSE III caught the burst as well, and at the beginning of their observations the afterglow was at astonishing 13th magnitude, making it easily visible in small telescopes (if you happened to be looking at the right spot at the same time!).

Astronomers at the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT150, Bakyrlytepe, TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey) report a possible host galaxy for the burst, though it is very faint and has not yet been confirmed by any other observatories.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 060108 has the distinction of being Swift's 100th detected burst!

It lasted about 20 seconds, showing two peaks of gamma-ray emission. The Swift X-Ray Telescope saw a fading X-ray source at that position.

It was initially reported that no afterglow was seen, but there was a slight offset in the reported position of the burst. When this was corrected, an afterglow was seen by several observatories (it was in their original data, but they were looking in the wrong place!). Using UKIRT, for example, astronomers did detect an afterglow in the near-infrared. Pre-burst images show the presence of a source there as well, which appears to be a bit extended. This is likely the host galaxy of the burst, which may allow a distance determination for this burst. In the meantime, a rough fit to the distance using the colors of the burst indicate a redshift of about 2, corresponding to a lookback time of about 10 billion years.</grb_description>

The X-Ray Telescope on Swift detected a bright, fading source, though no unambiguous optical counterpart was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope; a faint source was seen but it's not clear if this is the afterglow.

The Kiso observatory's 1.05-m Schmidt telescope was used ot image the area, and did not detect the source seen by the UVOT, which supports the idea that this source is the afterglow. We await further observations.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The early few seconds of this burst seen by Swift showed multiple peaks of gamma-ray emission, and then a long low peak from 30-50 seconds after the initial burst. The initial peak was seen by the HETE-2 satellite as well. The X-ray emission seen by Swift also had multiple peaks, the brightest occuring 115 seconds after the burst.

An optical afterglow was detected by several observatories. The Gemini north telescope definitely detected it (as displayed in the image here; the afterglow is marked S1). A second observation 38.6 hours later confirmed it was fading, indicating it is indeed the afterglow of the burst. The afterglow was extremely faint, at a near-infrared r magnitude of 24.8 (the faintest star viisble to the unaided eye is about 30 million times brighter).

However, there is still some confusion over this burst. After a few days, the afterglow stopped fading. This may mean that source S1 is actually the combination of the burst itself and the host galaxy of the burst. The burst faded rapidly, and quickly became too faint to detect, leaving only the galaxy to be seen. This would imply it was a short burst (longer bursts generally have a much longer afterglow). There is some indication in the initial gamma-ray emission that this may have been a short burst; the additional peaks seen were secondary flares, and not from the main burst itself. 

No distance for this galaxy has yet been reported.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a long event, lasting about 70 seconds, with broad peaks of emission. The X-Ray Telescope detected a fading source, but nothing was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope. Only one observatory reports seeing an afterglow-- the MDM 1.3 meter saw a source at R=21.3, but this is not yet confirmed. 

The burst is located very near the Galactic plane, which means that we are looking through dust and gas to see this burst. This does not affect gamma rays but makes optical follow-up more difficult, which may explain why very little has been seen.

It also implies that this may have been an object within our own Galaxy. However, the X-ray fading rate as observed by Swift appears to indicate this is more like a true GRB than a Galactic X-ray source. Still, the origin of this object is still something of a mystery.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a short, extremely bright burst -- in the top 3% of the brightest short bursts seen by Swift. There were multiple peaks in the first 0.6 seconds of the burst, which were only 0.1 seconds in duration. Yet, each one was very bright, delivering over 175,000 photons per second into the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. No later emission in gamma rays was seen. Gamma rays were also detected by the Konus-Wind satellite.

88 seconds later, the XRT started taking data, and a fading source was detected. Interestingly, there is indication of a brightening well after the peak. Analysis is ongoing. Later observations by the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory a day and a half after the burst also detected a fading X-ray source. 

A fading afterglow -- rare for a short burst -- was detected using the Gemini telescope (and confirmed a day later). It appears to be about 0.2 arcseconds from a steady source, which is presumed to be the host galaxy for the burst (the image displayed here is from Gemini, and a bigger version is available at   http://www.ociw.edu/~eberger/grb051221-gemini.tif). Followup observations indicate the galaxy is at a redshift of z=0.5465, corresponding to a lookback time of 5.3 billion years. The observations also indicate the galaxy itself is still actively creating stars, making this event possibly similar to GRB 050709. 

The afterglow was also detected in radio by the Very Large Array in New Mexico, and in ultraviolet by the Japanese Suzaku satellite.

Given this distance, this burst may have been the most luminous ever detected. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>Completing a trifecta of bursts after a three-week drought, INTEGRAL detected this 80-second long burst.

Swift has confirmed a detection of an X-ray afterglow, but its location is not consistent with a possible optical afterglow reported by a ground-based observatory. The optical afterglow detection, however, appears to have been marginal (that is, the glow was very faint and barely detected). Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope observed the GRB 3 hours after the burst and did not detect an afterglow.

A team at the 1.5-m OSN telescope at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada report seeing a fading afterglow in the I band (near infrared). It's in a crowded field and apparently on top of a fainted galaxy, making the magnitude measurement difficult. The animated image displayed shows the glow fading over the course of four days (from Dec. 11 to Dec 15). The image is from http://www.iaa.es/~deugarte/GRBs/051211B/GRB051211B.gif.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a moderately long burst, lasting about 8.5 seconds. No afterglow has been positively detected.

This burst was detected by HETE-2, and Swift was commanded to observe it shortly thereafter. Swift saw no X-ray afterglow, even though for many bursts an afterglow would have been detected at that point in time after the burst; in other words, this was a very faint burst in X-rays.

Astronomers using the 2-m Faulkes Telescope North report that they might have detected an optical afterglow, but the detection is very near the limit due to the bright Moon lighting up the sky. The image displayed shows the possible afterglow (the original is here: http://www.astro.livjm.ac.uk/~crg/GRB051211A_possible_OT_FTN.jpg). If it is the afterglow, it was at R=21.2 six hours after the initial burst.

		<grb_description>This was the first burst seen by any spacecraft in nearly three weeks! It was definitely a short burst, emitting gamma rays for less than 2 seconds, with three separate peaks. An X-ray afterglow was detected by Swift, but no optical afterglow was seen.

A possible afterglow was detected by the 6.5 meter Clay/Magellan telescope. It was extremely faint, and may be elongated, indicating a host galaxy. Again, this is a marginal detection. This is the image displayed, and a higher-resolution version can be found at http://astron.berkeley.edu/~jbloom/grb051210_find.pdf.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst emitted gamma rays for about 25 seconds, and the emission has multiple peaks. A faint source was seen in X-rays by Swift, but no optical afterglow. The proximity of the full Moon to the position of the burst in the sky has limited ground-based follow-up observations. No optical afterglow has yet been reported.

An extended source, possibly the GRB host galaxy, was seen by a team using the Danish 1.54m telescope on La Silla. If this is the GRB host galaxy, a redshift might be able to be found. The image above is from that observation, and a larger version can be found at http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb051117.558/.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a bright burst with a single peak in gamma rays, lasting over 200 seconds. The emission brightened quickly and faded slowly, typical of such long bursts. There is some hint of peaks late in the burst, at 225 and 350 seconds after the initial burst. It was detected both by the X-Ray and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope.

Followup observations taken 140 days after the burst with the Tautenburg 1.34m telescope reveal no host galaxy for this burst down to a magnitude of R=24.0.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this extremely bright burst when it was too close to the apparent position of the Moon on the sky for an automatic slew. Still, the burst was seen to last about 50 seconds, with a 10 second rise and 40 second decay, with some indication it lasted an additional 30 seconds. It was easily seen in the X-Ray and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescopes as well.

This was an extraordinarily bright burst, one of the brightest ever seen. The ROTSE III telescope was able to get an observation 26.9 seconds after the burst started, and reported a magnitude of 13! While not as bright as the famous GRB 990123 (which peaked at magnitude 9) this is still a very bright burst, and many observatories report detecting it at multiple wavelengths, including radio waves. 

Observers on the Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii took spectra, and report a redshift of z=1.54948 (yes, that accurately!) which corresponds to a lookback time of 9.44 billion years. The spectrum is very rich in details, and the astronomers report that they find evidence that the burst occurred in a large, thick, warm cloud of gas. This may represent the nebula from which the GRB progenitor star was born. In fact, they say that the amount of silicon and zinc in this cloud is higher than ever seen outside our local group of galaxies (the galaxies within about 5 million light years of the Milky Way).

The PAIRITEL telescope has an image of the GRB at http://astron.berkeley.edu/~jbloom/grb051111a.gif (this is the image displayed here) and an old survey picture of that same field for comparison.
We are eagerly awaiting more reports on this very exciting burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This faint burst seen by Swift had a single peak in gamma rays, and lasted for about 15 seconds. The X-Ray Telescope detected a very faint and fading X-ray source. Several telescopes observed the GRB location, but none has reported seeing an afterglow.

Update (August 8, 2006): A followup observation reveals a barred spiral host galaxy at the location of the burst. The location was determined well enough that it was found that the burst happened inside a spiral arm of the galaxy. The galaxy is at a z = 0.080 corresponding to a distance of about a billion light years.

It was also seen by Konus-WIND, which saw a long tail of emission lasting 130 seconds. The Swift X-Ray Telescope saw a fading X-ray afterglow, and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope detected the optical afterglow at v=16.49 just two minutes after the burst. It was detected in radio waves by the Very Large Array in New mexico as well.

The 9.2 meter Hobby-Eberly Telescope was able to get a redshift for this burst of z=2.346, corresponding to a lookback time of 10.8 billion years.
The Raptor-S robotic telescope at Los Alamos National Laboratory made several observations of the burst, which were made into a very interesting animated image at http://www.raptor.lanl.gov/images/GRB051109a/grb051109a_early_movie.gif, where you can see the afterglow fade over four minutes of observations. A second animation of the next 30 minutes are at http://www.raptor.lanl.gov/images/GRB051109a/grb051109a_late_movie.gif. These are big and may take a few minutes to load.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was detected by the Konus-WIND experiment as well as by a gamma-ray detector on board Mars Odyssey, orbiting the Red Planet. The position is approximate due to coarse nature of the triangulation. It was a short burst, lasting about 0.17 seconds. It had a very steep rise and a longer fade. 

Incredibly, the position of this burst coincides with the bright, nearby spiral galaxy M81, which is easily visible in binoculars. The shape of the burst's light curve is similar to that of "Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters", neutron stars that give out episodic blasts of gamma rays (like the famous SGR 1806-20, which erupted violently in December 2004). An SGR from M81 would possibly be detectable from Earth if it were a particularly energetic outburst. It should be noted that there is also a faint elliptical galaxy near this position as well.

Hopefully, this burst will continue to be monitored. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>HETE-2 detected this burst, which lasted for approximately 16 seconds. It was also detected by the Konus-WIND satellite. Swift observed this GRB about 7 hours after the detection, and saw a fading X-ray afterglow, but nothing with the Ultraviolet/Optical telescope.

However, the optical was detected by several ground-based telescopes. At 3.6 hours after the burst, the I magnitude was 19 as reported by a team using the 1.34-meter Tautenburg Schmidt telescope in Jena, Germany. It was also seen by the 4.2 meter William Herschel Telescope (that is the image displayed here).

		<grb_description>This was a very long burst, lasting at least 200 seconds. It was initially detected by HETE-2, but was also seen by the Konus-WIND experiment. Not only that, it was detected by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft currently orbiting the red planet!

The Swift X-Ray Telescope saw a bright, fading source. The afterglow was also seen in radio and microwave wavelengths as well.

There are several reports of optical afterglows. There are three sources near the burst position, one of which is extended and is likely to be the host galaxy for the burst. Spectra taken on the venerable 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory in California indicate the galaxy is a redshift of z=0.8, corresponding to a distance of 6.8 billion light years.

It is still unclear which of the sources may be the optical afterglow of this burst, or even if *any* of them are. We await further, deeper observations.

		<grb_description>HETE-2 detected this 50 second long burst, which shows two distinct peaks of gamma-ray emission separated by about 10 seconds. Three hours after the burst, Swift slewed to the location and detected the fading X-ray afterglow. 

The ROTSE III telescope caught the afterglow on the rise (which is very rare), seeing it at an unfiltered magnitude of 16.9 three minutes after the burst, and then seeing it fade. About 12 hours after the burst, the SOAR 4.1 meter telescope caught the burst at a J (near infrared) magnitude of 17.16.

Early on, the colors of the burst (the brightness in different filters) indicated it may be another high-redshift burst like GRB 050904, but later observations have cast doubt on this. Without a spectrum it may never be known how far away this burst was.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst lasted about 15 seconds, and had two overlapping peaks of emission at 0.3 and 3.0 seconds. An uncatalogued source was detected by the X-Ray Telescope, and appeared to be fading over about 100 seconds. The Ultraviolet/Optical telescope reports seeing a faint optical afterglow at B=22, which is near the limit of the telescope's ability. 

At least three ground-based observatories are reporting a very faint afterglow, but reports right now are inconsistent (they report different positions). Hopefully this will be cleared up soon, but given the faintness of the reported afterglow, this discrepancy may never be resolved.

On Halloween night, the GRB position was observed with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the Keck I 10-meter telescope, and an extended source, presumably the host galaxy, was seen. The redshift of the galaxy was determined to be z=0.9364, corresponding to a lookback time of 7.5 billion years.</grb_description>

The joint NASA-ESA X-ray observatory XMM-Newton has begun observations of this burst. The afterglow was detected, and fades in a way consistent with the Swift observations.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Unfortunately, this burst was near the Earth-observing limit for Swift (which is not allowed to point too close to the Earth because it's too bright), so the information from Swift is somewhat limited. There were two overlapping gamma-ray peaks in emission, followed by a third about 40 seconds later. The gamma-ray emission continued for at least a minute, but observing was cut off at that time due to the pointing constraint.

The Konus-WIND satellite detected this burst (as did the Japanese Suzaku satellite), and was able to follow it for longer than Swift did. The team reports that the burst lasted about 250 seconds, with several peaks of emission, including one lasting 9 seconds that started about 210 seconds after the burst.

Swift's X-Ray Telescope detected a fading source, but nothing was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical telescope or any ground-based follow-ups.

The Tautenburg 1.34m Schmidt telescope observed the burst for three nights in late October, and clearly detected a galaxy in the GRB position, but did *not* see the afterglow. They did now see any re-brightening of the burst as might be expected for a supernova explosion, which implies the blast was under-powered, or there is a lot of obscuring dust in the host galaxy. This is similar to GRB 051022 which apparently had quite a bit of local dust blocking our view of the burst.</grb_description>

The X-Ray Telescope detected a faint, fading X-ray source, that underwent several flares of emission.

Ground-based telescopes report no firm detections of an optical afterglow (although there is a marginal detection reported by the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory at http://grb.rssi.ru/GRB051006/grb051006_051008_ZTSh_R.gif).

		<grb_description>Swift has detected another short burst-- but it may not be a GRB! This one had a single, sharp spike of gamma-ray emission lasting just 0.068 seconds (68 milliseconds). 

This burst was "soft", meaning that the gamma rays seen were not as high-energy as usual. Interestingly, the burst is located almost exactly on the Galactic plane, which is a strong indication it was an event inside our Milky Way, and not from some extragalactic source like most GRBs. This makes it likely it was a "soft gamma-ray repeater", a dense neutron star that sometimes flares, giving off gamma rays (such as the very strong blast Swift detected in December 2004; see http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/watchtheskies/swift_nsu_0205.html for details). If this is true, it is a previously unknown SGR.

Since this burst was located in the plane of the Milky Way, the burst region is extremely crowded with stars (see this image of the burst location taken with the PAIRITEL telescope as an example: http://astro.berkeley.edu/~jbloom/sgr2013+34.gif). It also means there is a lot of gas and dust between us and the burst, so optical light is likely to be blocked. In fact, no optical afterglow was seen for this burst (which is in itself not unusual for short bursts anyway). Estimates are that any source will be fainter by more than 7 magnitudes when viewed in this direction, which significantly reduces the brightness of any afterglow. Although radio waves can penetrate this dust, no radio emission was seen from this source. No emission was seen by the X-ray Telescope on Swift, either.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very bright burst! The gamma-ray duration was about 5 seconds, and showed multiple peaks of emission. This burst was also detected by the HETE-2 and Konus-WIND satellites, both of which confirm the duration and shape of the gamma-ray light curve as well.

The X-Ray Telescope on Swift detected a bright, fading source, as did the Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope-- at 111 seconds after the trigger, the burst was at a visual magnitude of 14.6, which was easily within the range of small telescopes.

That explains the large number of followup observations! Many observers report a detection of the burst (including one amateur astronomer; experienced GRB-hunter Douglas Durig in Tennessee). Within a few hours the optical afterglow had faded to about magnitude 19.

The Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) on the island of La Palma was used to take a spectrum of the burst, and a very solid observation yields a redshift of z=2.198, corresponding to a distance of 10.6 billion light years.

The image displayed is from the NOT (http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb050922.830/).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this long, weak burst using what's called an "image trigger"; an image built up over time versus a sudden "flare" of gamma-ray emission. The last GRB found this way was GRB050904A, which was the very high-redshift burst. The burst showed two very broad peaks in gamma-ray emission, one lasting 50 seconds, and the second for 30 seconds. The total duration of the main event was about 110 seconds, with some peaks of gamma-ray emission happening as late as 275 seconds after the original trigger.

The X-Ray Telescope detected a fading source 342 seconds after the trigger. There were also two flares of emission occurring 370 and 846 seconds after the burst. No optical afterglow was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope to a magnitude of 18.7. No ground based telescope report detecting it either.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 050915A had a complex gamma-ray profile, showing at least seven peaks (each about 2 seconds long) in the first 30 seconds of the burst, and another about 43 seconds after Swift was triggered. The total duration about 1 minute.

The X-Ray Telescope detected a source which rose briefly in brightness before fading. The Ultraviolet/Optical telescope did not detect any source down to V=20.3 in observations starting 85 seconds after the burst. No ground-based observatory detected the burst in optical light, either. Radio observations using the Very Large Array in New Mexico also did not detect this burst.

The burst was detected in the infrared, however. Observations starting 11 minutes after the burst using the PAIRITEL telescope show a source at H=18.25, which faded by at least 0.3 magnitudes over the course of 24 hours. The image displayed shows the initial PAIRITEL observation (http://astron.berkeley.edu/~jbloom/grb050915_jhk.gif).

The detection in infrared, with no optical counterpart, means that either the burst is heavily obscured by dust in the host galaxy, or it is so far away that the emission from the burst is highly redshifted (as was GRB 050904A). We await further observations on this interesting burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>It is probable that this was not a real burst. Swift detected the event just as it was entering the South Atlantic Anomaly, a region of Earth's magnetic field with a relatively large amount of particle radiation. It seems likely this event was due to this; the X-Ray Telescope and the Ultraviolet/Optical telescopes did not detect any afterglow at all. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a long burst showing multiple short peaks of emission. The light curve is complex, but indicates the burst lasted about 20 seconds. A previously uncatalogued X-ray source was initially detected by Swift at the position of the burst, but it did not fade over time and is therefore certainly unrelated to the burst.

Interestingly, this burst occurred very close in the sky to a cluster of galaxies at a redshift of z=0.165, corresponding to a distance of 2 billion light years, it is unknown if the burst's host galaxy is a member of that cluster or not.</grb_description>

The optical afterglow was seen first by amateur astronomer D. T. Durig at the Cordell-Lorenz Observatory, who reported in on behalf of the AAVSO International High Energy Network (http://www.aavso.org/observing/programs/hen/). It was seen a few minutes later by professional astronomers, though the pros reported it first. The burst peaked at an R (red) magnitude of about 19 and faded rapidly.

Astronomers at the Gemini observatory were able to secure a redshift for the burst of z = 3.3437, corresponding to a lookback time of 11.7 billion years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a short burst, lasting only about 0.13 seconds. Very interestingly, there is a relatively bright (K magnitude = 11.5) galaxy very close to the position of the burst. It is highly unlikely to get a galaxy as bright as this by coincidence, indicating it might be the host galaxy for the burst. The galaxy, called IC 328 is only about 500 million light years away, very close as GRBs go. 

Only two previous short bursts have had known host galaxies (GRB 050509b and GRB 050724), and those were both old elliptical galaxies. IC 328 is a spiral, and is blue, indicating it has active star formation still occurring.

The Swift X-Ray Telescope has spotted two sources near the burst, but it is unsure if either is the burst itself. The galaxy does not appear to be producing detectable X-rays. No optical afterglow has been seen at all, though there was a radio source found; but, like the X-ray source, it is unsure if this is from the burst or not.</grb_description>

		<redshift>6.29</redshift>
		<grb_description>This was a relatively long burst, lasting about 200 seconds. 

This burst has set a new distance record: its redshift was z=6.29, corresponding to a distance of 12.7 billion light years. The previous record-holding burst had a redshift of 4.5 (12.3 billion light years away). 

The first indication of its distance was that it was not seen at all at optical wavelengths, but it was definitely detected in the near infrared. This could indicate significant dust in the burst's host galaxy which absorbs optical light and lets infrared through. However, the brightness and fading rate observed didn't support this conclusion. 

This means the burst is very far away. Its great distance means that its light is redshifted, moved toward lower energies. Because of absorption by material between the burst and the Earth, any ultraviolet light emitted never reaches us. Because of the huge redshift for this burst, this means that this "ultraviolet desert" is shifted to optical. So we see no optical light, but we still see infrared.

The high redshift of this burst was confirmed using the Subaru 8.2 meter telescope in Hawaii, which measured the whopping z=6.29 redshift for this burst.

This burst was the subject of a NASA press conference, which had many graphics, including images of the burst, plots of its emission, and other background material. This can be found at http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/2005_distant_grb.html.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 050827 had two gamma-ray peaks. The first lasted about 24 seconds, and was bright. The second, much fainter, started about 25 seconds later and laster about 3 seconds. Because the burst happened near the Moon in the sky, Swift could not slew to observe it for nearly 18 hours. By then, no optical afterglow was seen. An uncatalogued X-ray source was present, but it is unclear if this is the afterglow or not. Further observations will be made.

No ground-based telescopes saw an afterglow either.

		<grb_description>Swift immediately slewed when it detected this burst, which lasted for about 45 seconds. Two distinct peaks in gamma-ray emission were seen. The X-Ray Telescope saw a fading X-ray source, but there is no indication it was detected in optical wavelengths.

J. P. Halpern reports on behalf of the MDM Observatory GRB follow-up team that they saw an optical afterglow candidate about 5 hours after the burst, at R=21, and it faded by half a magnitude by a day later. They are continuing their observations to confirm this as the afterglow.

Update (Dec. 30, 2006): Current observations reveal a possible host galaxy with a redshift of 0.297, corresponding to a distance of 3.4 billion light years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>The duration of this weak burst was about 25 seconds. The gamma-ray emission rose and fell slowly. Because the burst was near the Moon in the sky as seen by Swift, the spacecraft could not slew immediately over to the burst. When Swift did slew, there were two X-ray sources detected using the X-Ray Telescope, with one fading over the course of the observation, indicating it is the X-ray afterglow. This burst was also seen in gamma rays by the HETE-2 spacecraft.

A very faint optical afterglow was detected by the MASTER telescope at Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow, and was seen somewhat better by the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (OSN) in Spain. The image displayed is from the OSN (http://www.dsri.dk/~jgu/grb050824/FCs/osn.R.gif)

A redshift was determined using the Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii, and they found a z=0.83, corresponding to a lookback time of about 7 billion years, relatively close as GRBs go. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this 13-second-long burst near the southern celestial pole. From Swift's view, the burst was too near the Earth's disk to slew immediately, but about 30 minutes later it was able to acquire the target. Worse, when the burst was finally visible to Swift, the spacecraft was in the South Atlantic Anomaly, a region of space where the Earth's magnetic field dips down a bit, bringing energetic charged particles down to the height of Swift's orbit. This can confuse the spacecraft, and Swift did have a hard time finding the X-rays from the burst. However, ground analysis did reveal a faint, fading X-ray source.

The orbiting X-ray telescope XMM-Newton also observed this burst, and scientists report that they have clearly detected the afterglow, which faded over the observation (which was from 5.5 to 22 hours after the burst).</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst showed a broad, double-humped light curve in gamma rays, lasting about 20 seconds. There are several peaks in emission superposed on the broader humps. The X-Ray Telescope detected a bright, fading source in X-rays as well. The Ultraviolet-Optical Telescope was on the burst in just over a minute, and detected an afterglow that initially got brighter and then faded. 

After the initial burts, there were two more episodes of gamma-ray emission seen from this burst. Interestingly, the second two were larger than the first! They were also seen by both INTEGRAL and Konus-WIND. The other two episodes were broad peaks of emission that occurred four and seven minutes *after* the initial burst. 

This burst was quite bright, and seen by many ground-based telescopes across the optical spectrum (one reports an unfiltered magnitude of 14.5, which is very bright). About a day after the burst, it was detected in radio waves using the Very large Array in New Mexico. In fact, 87 hours after the burst -- more than 3.5 days -- the afterglow was still detected in optical wavelengths (R=21.3) by the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey). They continue following-up, and still see the afterglow more than 182 hours after the burst (at R=22.1).

Observations using the Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii determine the burst's redshift to be z=2.612, corresponding to a lookback time of 11.1 billion years.

The image displayed is from the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (Bakirlitepe, TUBITAK National Observatory, Turkey), and the light curve displayed is from the Konus-WIND experiment.

		<grb_description>This burst had a 135 second long, broad peak of emission in gamma rays. It brightened to a maximum in about 20 seconds, then faded more gradually. A fading X-ray source was seen as well, though no optical afterglow was detected by Swift.

There have been several ground-based follow-ups, but only one has reported a fading afterglow: the Nordic Optical Telescope, which says the afterglow is very red, indicating either great distance or (more likley) absorption by interstellar dust. The image displayed is from that observation. They have also reported that their candidate afterglow is fading, so it seems likely this is indeed the afterglow of the burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 050813 was a very short burst. An extremely sharp spike in emission was detected, lasting only 32 milliseconds (0.032 seconds), which occurred on top of a slightly broader peak lasting about 0.6 seconds. There is a hint of another spike 1.3 seconds later, but that is not clear.

An extremely faint X-ray afterglow was seen by Swift, which faded a few minutes after detection. No optical afterglow was seen despite attempts by many observatories.

Short bursts like this one are more difficult to observe than the longer ones, and may have a different source: two merging neutron stars, and not the explosion of a supermassive star. This type of GRB can occur in older, elliptical galaxies (see, for example, GRB 05059b) so the identification of a host galaxy is important. There is some indication, though weak, of a galaxy cluster near the location of this GRB. There will certainly be more follow-up observations of this burst in the coming days.

		<grb_description>This was a long burst, lasting about 150 seconds in total. There were several peaks in gamma-ray emission, including a sharp one 145 seconds after the initial event, which is unusual even for GRBs. 

The burst was seen in X-rays as well, but Swift did not detect an optical afterglow.

Some ground-based telescopes report a marginal detection of a source, but it is still uncertain if this is the afterglow of the burst or not. Astronomers using the Keck telescope in Hawaii report a galaxy at the position of the burst at a  redshift of z=0.422 corresponding to a distance of 4.4 billion light years, but it is unknown if this is the host galaxy for the burst.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had three distinct peaks and lasted about 20 seconds (with a hint of a third peak 35 seconds after the first). A fading source was seen in both X-rays and optical by Swift. 

Observations using the Nordic Optical Telescope show the burst fading by about 2 magnitudes in a singly day, and may indicate the host galaxy for the burst (see the displayed image, or go to http://www.astro.ku.dk/~brian_j/grb/grb050802.422/). 

Judging by the Swift optical and UV data, the burst may have been at a redshift of z=1.2, or 8.5 billion year lookback time. Astronomers using the Nordic Optical Telescope report a tentative redshift of z=1.7 (9.8 billion year lookback time), which is somewhat at odds with the Swift redshift. More observations will be needed to clear this up.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst had an initial peak followed by a second, weaker one 3 seconds later. An optical afterglow was positively seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope in all filters. 

The Swift X-Ray Telescope data start 89 seconds after the burst, and shows a constant brightness in X-rays from 90 seconds out to 300 seconds, then decays. 

The ROTSE III telescope in Namibia, Africa reports a possible afterglow for this burst at an unfiltered magnitude of 15. Interestingly, they also report the brightness of the optical afterglow was constant for about the first three minutes, then suddenly declined rapidly. This is much like what the Swift X-Ray Telescope saw, so scientists will be eagerly studying that data.

B. Monard of the Bronberg Observatory detected the afterglow about 35 minutes after the burst, with a magnitude of R=17.5, and it faded nearly an entire magnitude in the next 11 minutes.

		<redshift>3.967</redshift>
		<grb_description>Swift detected this weak burst, which lasted from about 160 seconds. It had a slow, 60-70 second rise, followed by an equally gradual decline. The X-Ray Telescope detected a rapidly fading source (with at least three separate spikes of brightness), and the optical afterglow was also detected (at V = 17.62) in the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope.

This burst, though weak in gamma rays, had a relatively bright afterglow at other wavelengths. The Observatorio de Sierra Nevada in Spain saw it at a red (R) magnitude of 17, which is similar to what was seen by the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3m telescope at CTIO (Chile): I ~ 17.2 and J ~ 16.3 about 3 hours after the burst. They also report the afterglow faded rapidly.

What's very exciting is that a redshift has been found, and this burst is quite far away. The MIKE echelle spectrograph on Magellan II started observations
4 hours after the initial Swift trigger, and they report a redshift z=3.967 based on a very strong set of data. This corresponds to a lookback time of 12.1 billion years! This measurement has been confirmed by
a team using the ISIS spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on La Palma, in the Canary Islands. 

This high redshift means time dilation is a factor-- objects at high redshift appear to us to have their clocks "tick slower", as Einstein proposed in the relativity theory. This GRB actually will have its time slowed relative to us by a factor of 5 (this is equal to its redshift+1 as these things are calculated), so it actually lasted about 30 seconds in its own rest frame. 

The orbiting X-ray observatory XMM-Newton observed the burst, and a preliminary analysis shows it was detected. We will report here as we learn more about this very interesting burst. The burst was also detected in radio wavelengths using the Very Large Array on Socorro, New Mexico.

The image displayed is of the afterglow from M. Holman's team using the Magellan telescope. A higher-res version is available at http://www.nd.edu/~pgarnavi/grb050730.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this weak burst which lasted about 30 seconds. Unfortunately, a gap in the communication satellite coverage meant that real-time notification was not made, so there was no immediate follow-up from the ground. However, Swift did detect a fading X-ray source at the burst location (which flared twice in the following 200 seconds, possibly as interstellar gas surrounding the burst was hit by shock waves from the explosion), and may have also seen the afterglow in optical wavelengths as well. Analysis of the data is ongoing.

Follow-up observations using a PROMPT telescope did not detect any optical afterglow.</grb_description>

		<redshift>0.257</redshift>
		<grb_description>This was a short burst, with an initial pulse of energy lasting about 0.25 seconds, then another one about a second later. Swift slewed to the burst in about 75 seconds, and the X-Ray Telescope detected a bright, rapidly fading X-ray source (the Chandra X-ray observatory also detected the fading X-ray afterglow). No source was detected by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope down to a visible magnitude of 18.84.

Early follow-up observations were a bit difficult to interpret due to the presence of two faint background stars. However, an extended source near the position of the burst has been identified as a galaxy, and astronomers using the 1.0-m Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory have confirmed they see a faint optical afterglow superposed on that galaxy (the image displayed shows this afterglow; "OT" stands for "optical transient"). It is logical to assume the burst originated in the galaxy. Spectra taken of the galaxy using the giant Gemini telescope indicate a redshift of z=0.257, corresponding to a lookback time of nearly 3 billion years for this burst.

This burst has also had a radio wave afterglow identified as well.

NEW! Analysis of the Swift X-ray data shows that the X-rays from this burst have scattered off dust in our own Galaxy, creating a ring-shaped halo of X-rays centered on the burst. The ring appears to expand, and from this astronomers have calculated that the dust lies about 500 light years away (note: the burst itself was 3 *billion* light years away, so this ring is definitely a local effect).

		<grb_description>NOTE: There have been several bursts alerts today, but this one is evidently the only bona-fide burst seen. At least one was a previously known source, and we await confirmation of the other ones.

This GRB has an initial peak of emission that lasted for about 5-10 seconds, with a long 50 second decay. The X-Ray Telescope detected an uncatalogued, fading source which is the X-ray afterglow.

This one had a bright optical afterglow as well. A 0.3 meter telescope at the New Mexico Skies observatory reports the afterglow to have a magnitude of I (near-infrared) of 15 6 minutes after the burst, though it was very close to a bright star. This has been confirmed by the mammoth 8-meter European Southern Observatory telescope ESO-VLT UT2. Several other observatories are following-up.

		<grb_description>This bright burst was a bit unusual: it had a sharp spike of emission, followed by a strong peak with a 20 second decay. It also had two "precursor" peaks; smaller jumps in brightness before the big one. The total duration of the burst was about 86 seconds. 

Swift slewed to the source and 79 seconds after the burst, the X-Ray Telescope saw a strong, fading X-ray source. No optical afterglow was detected by Swift. No afterglow was detected by one of the Tenagra 0.35 meter telescopes in Perth Australia, about 24 hours after the burst.

It was initially reported that the Las Campanas du Pont 100-inch telescope found 3 faint uncatalogued sources in the near-infrared near the position of the burst. However further observations revealed that none of them has faded, making all of them unlikely to be the afterglow of the burst.


The Konus-WIND satellite also detected the GRB, and saw it for about 50 seconds.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This is a long burst, lasting about 70 seconds, with what appears to be a single, long, smooth hump of emission. The spectrum indicates it's "soft", meaning the energies of the gamma rays detected have been low, more like hard X-rays. 

A candidate optical afterglow spotted by the Very Large Telescope in Chile does not appear to be panning out; it is not fading (and new analysis of the Swift data indicate it is too far from the location of the burst to be the afterglow). 

More information is expected on this burst.</grb_description>

Swift observed this burst 13.7 hours after the event and found a faint X-ray source. Observations taken 5 days after the burst show the source is gone, confirming that this was the X-ray afterglow.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift detected this very bright burst and slewed to the target in 70 seconds. The X-Ray Telescope found a "very bright" fading source at the position of the burst, but the Ultraviolet/Optical telescope did not see an afterglow.

The burst itself lasted about 70 seconds, with an initial 12-second bump in emission followed by several smaller peaks. Those peaks were seen both in the Burst Alert Telescope (sensitive to very high energy X-rays) and the X-Ray Telescope (sensitive to lower energy X-rays). The Konus-WIND satellite also detected this GRB.

ROTSE III observed this GRB in an astonishing 10.7 seconds after the burst alert was sent out automatically by Swift. No optical afterglow was seen down to a limiting magnitude of 17.7.

However, the Italian TNG telescope, located at the Canary Islands, reported a very faint source in the I (near infrared) band, and this was confirmed to be fading by other observatories. Another observatory, however, saw nothing at that position 30 minutes after the burst down to a magnitude of 18.2 in the I band. The afterglow image posted here is from Malesani et al., using the Italian TNG telescope.

The RAPTOR-S telescope at Los Alamos National Laboratory began observations 22 seconds after the burst, and found a fading optical afterglow at magnitude 18.4 in the R (red) band.

The orbiting X-Ray observatory XMM-Newton observed this burst, and reports a strong detection of it. Analysis indicates that the burst was seen to fade, and in fact the fading rate increased over time (it started fading faster, in other words). When the fading rate suddenly increases like this, it may mean the ejected matter in the burst has suddenly slowed, revealing physics about the burst itself. Scientists will continue to analyze this data.

From Swift's X-ray data, the burst appears to be heavily obscured by dust, more so than is usual for dust in our Galaxy. This hints that the burst may have occurred in a dust-laden region of its own galaxy.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very weak burst, with a long, smooth emission over 48 seconds. Swift immediately slewed to observe it. A rapidly fading source was found using the X-Ray Telescope (it was too faint for the on-board software to detect it, but it was seen when the data were processed on the ground by scientists).

A fading source was seen in the Ultraviolet/Optical telescope in the visual band but not the ultraviolet. Interestingly, as the source faded it brightened a bit for a minute or so before fading again. This may indicate that there is gas and dust around the burst that was lit up by the flash.

14.4 hours after the burst, the Italian TNG telescope, located at the Canary Islands, detected the GRB optical afterglow in the R band, at a magnitude of 21.4.

		<grb_description>HETE-2 detected this short burst. It lasted a mere 1/10 of a second, and 30 seconds later was followed by a longer 150 second "pulse" of emission that had a much lower energy (X-rays instead of gamma rays). A problem on board HETE-2 didn't allow real-time follow-up. The PROMPT telescope responded 27 hours after the burst alert, but found no new optical sources. The Swope telescope in the Canary Islands also followed-up and found no new sources. Swift observed this burst 38 hours after the event, and like the other telescopes did not detect any optical afterglow.

The orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory took an observation of this burst, and found a source that appeared to be the afterglow; a second set of observations taken in July confirmed it becuase the the X-ray source had faded.

The image posted is from Jensen et al. using the Danish 1.54 meter telescope in La Silla, Chile. They found an optical counterpart very near another source which may be the host galaxy. Image analysis has confirmed this source to be fading. This appears to clinch it as the fading afterglow of this GRB.

That galaxy was observed by the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii, and was found to be at a redshift of z=0.16 corresponding to a lookback time about 2 billion years ago, relatively recent as these things go. If this burst is associated with the galaxy, this will be only the second short, hard burst seen in a nearby galaxy, the other being GRB 050509B.

Work will continue on this interesting object.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This 40-second-long burst showed complex structure in the gamma-ray light curve, with many peaks and dips during the event. Interestingly, it's located 40 arcminutes (a little more than the apparent width of the full Moon) from a known gamma-ray source, so Swift's software thought the *burst* was the known source. Because of this, Swift did not automatically slew to the burst. Observations were made with the Ultraviolet/Optical telescope onboard Swift, but no afterglow was detected. This may have been due to the 1.6 hour delay between the burst and the observations. However, a fading X-ray source was detected by the X-Ray Telescope.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst, detected by INTEGRAL, lasted approximately 60 seconds. Preliminary analysis shows it was X-ray rich, meaning it gave off a lot of X-rays compared to other energies of light.

The burst was located very near a bright star (Alpha Crucis, the star marking the base of the Southern Cross) which has hampered optical searches somewhat. The Mt.  John Astronomical Observatory in New Zealand reports no optical counterpart down to magnitude 20 about 4 hours after the burst.

Swift was not able to promptly observe this burst because it was located too near the position of the Earth as seen from Swift. It was three days before Swift could observe it, and by then the source had certainly faded from view. Only a single X-ray source was seen by Swift when it slewed to the position reported by INTEGRAL, but the source did not fade, indicating it was not the GRB. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This 30-second-long burst exhibited three peaks in emission before fading away in gamma rays. Within 17 seconds of the initial trigger, Swift slewed to its position and started taking X-ray data and optical data. It detected a fading X-ray source, but the optical data has not been processed yet.

A very faint, fading source seen 9 minutes after the initial burst was reported by an astronomer using the 4-meter Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak. This was confirmed by Jules Halpern at Columbia University on behalf of the MDM Observatory (who provided the afterglow image displayed). Followup Mayall data also show that the burst faded by nearly three magnitudes in a day. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>Unfortunately, when this burst happened, Swift was in "engineering mode", which means tests were being run on it so it was not able to slew and observe the GRB with its other instruments. However, it was also detected by both INTEGRAL and Konus-WIND, which indicate the burst lasted for about 10 seconds and had three distinct peaks in its emission. Analysis of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope data corroborates this. 

The earliest report of an optical afterglow showed it to be at a relatively bright magnitude of 16.5. It was also seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope onboard Swift, and has been detected in radio wavelengths as well. Analysis of the X-Ray Telescope data from Swift also show a fading X-ray afterglow for this burst.

The Magellan/Baade telescope reports they obtained a redshift for the GRB of z=2.821, corresponding to a lookback time of 11.3 billion years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This is one of Swift's brightest bursts of the year! It showed two peaks, for a total duration of about 10 seconds. About six minutes later, the ROTSE III telescope in Namibia was able to get images, and saw the optical afterglow at magnitude 14.7, easily within reach of small telescopes, and followup observations show it to be fading as expected. The afterglow image shown on the "burst details" page is from the ROTSE III group.

This burst has now been detected at many wavelengths of light, and was even spied by the INTEGRAL and Konus-WIND satellites. There is some indication that these two satellites may have actually seen another, different burst! Furthermore, Swift may have detected this second, separate event. Analysis is ongoing.

A team of astronomers has made a direct measurement of the GRB spectrum, and they find the redshift to be 0.6, corresponding to a lookback time of 5.7 billion years. A second group also measured a redshift using another method and found it to be 0.72 +/- 0.15, consistent with the other redshift measurement of 0.6.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This event was a 15 seconds long and exhibited a double peak of emission. However, it did *not* give off any very high-energy photons (what are called "hard" X-rays or "soft" gamma rays), and so this is being characterized as an "X-Ray Flash" (XRF) and not a gamma-ray burst. 

An XRF is an event similar to a gamma-ray burst but with much lower energy. Scientists are not sure if XRFs are the same as gamma-ray bursts but seen at an oblique angle, or if they are an entirely different phenomenon. Swift observed an XRF earlier in the year, in April 2005 (GRB 050406A).

Swift has slewed to observe GRB 050522A, and detected a weak X-ray source, but it has not yet been determined if it is fading, as an XRF would be expected to do. There was no optical detection using the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>*UPDATE* June 10, 2005: The GRB has been detected in radio wavelengths using the VLA radio telescope in New Mexico.

*UPDATE* June 6, 2005: A few days after this GRB was seen, some researchers speculated that the gamma rays detected might be a prompt flash from a supernova, an exploding star. They noted that monitoring of this GRB should continue for several weeks to see if it would get bright optically, since supernovae can take a few days or weeks to brighten. Astronomers using the 8-meter Gemini telescope as late as May 28 report no new optical source down to an astonishingly faint magnitude of 27.4, meaning that this GRB is unlikely to produce a supernova counterpart. However, telescopes are still observing this unusual burst.


*UPDATE* (May 11, 11:00 a.m. Pacific time): follow-up observations of this burst from quite a number of observatories indicate that reports of an optical afterglow may have been premature. There are several sources near the position of the burst reported by Swift, but it appears that none of them is fading as an afterglow would. This means they are most likely very distant background galaxies, which appear point-like and can confuse the issue. This is still a situation in progress, so come back to this page to see more updates.




This was a *very* short burst, lasting just 30 milliseconds (0.03 seconds)! Swift was able to slew to the burst in well under a minute. Analysis of the X-Ray Telescope shows a very faint detection of X-rays from the burst, and in fact this is the faintest X-ray afterglow Swift has yet detected this early from a burst.

This is potentially a very exciting burst. It appears very near a galaxy at a redshift of 0.226, corresponding to a distance of 2.7 billion light years-- relatively close by, as these things go. The galaxy itself is a member of the cluster NSC J123610+285901. If the burst was from that galaxy, it has a projected distance of about 100,000 light years from the galaxy center-- about the diameter of our own Milky Way Galaxy.

What is even more interesting is that this is an old galaxy; observations show it is not currently forming stars. This gives more support to the hypothesis that short-duration bursts are not from hypernovae, or exploding high-mass stars. Only young stars explode as hypernovae, and this galaxy has no young stars! The current hypothesis is that short bursts are from merging neutron stars, which means this would only happen in older systems (it can take billions of years for the orbits of two neutron stars to decay enough to allow them to merge, but when they finally do, the explosion is very short in length, only a few milliseconds).

		<grb_description>This burst lasted about 12 seconds, with one main peak of emission and one smaller one. Swift slewed over the burst and the X-Ray Telescope took data in less than a minute after the trigger, but detected no X-ray emission. The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope also saw no afterglow down to a magnitude of 17.3. ROTSE-III was on the burst in only 24 seconds, and also saw no optical afterglow.

However, the 2.6 meter Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands reports that they did detect a new source in the near-infrared I band, at a magnitude of 21.7. The source is not fading, and may not be an afterglow, however; it might be a previously undetected galaxy. </grb_description>

We also note that this is most likely the only *real* burst on this day. GRBs 050507 A and B are most likely software glitches in the software for this page, and will be deleted once we trace the problem, and this real burst will be relabeled as GRB 050507A.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was another long burst, lasting about a minute, with four distinct peaks. The X-Ray Telescope was able to detect a very faint afterglow, but nothing was seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical telescope. It was however detected in the infrared by the UKIRT 3.8 meter telescope in Hawaii nearly 7 hours after the burst.

It was also detected by the Keck 10 meter telescope, which was able to obtain a spectrum of the burst. This allowed them to determine a redshift of z=4.27 for it, which corresponds to a lookback time of 12.2 billion years.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst, detected by INTEGRAL, was very long, lasting about 80 seconds. Several ground-based follow-up observations reveal no optical counterpart. Interestingly, there is a bright (7th magnitude) star very close to the position reported for the burst. This is almost certainly a coincidence, but such a bright star means that its glare is affecting observations (like trying to see a cloud near the Sun, the brightness of the Sun makes it difficult). 

Swift slewed to this target and observed it, detecting a faint X-ray source. Followup observations taken on May 14 (ten days after the initial burst) showed that the X-ray source has faded from view, making it very likely to be the actual X-ray counterpart to the burst. 

There was no detection using Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a ~7 second long burst showing multiple peaks of emission. Swift slewed immediately to the burst. The X-Ray Telescope did not initially see a bright enough source to obtain any data due to the short exposure time, although later, with more observations, a bright X-ray source was found. 

It was reported here earlier that the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope did detect a new source at magnitude 17.7, but later analysis has shown this to be incorrect. No source has been seen in the UVOT images down to a magnitude of 18.5 in V.

A team at the Australian National University 1-meter telescope have confirmed that by 9 minutes after the burst, they detected an optical afterglow at magnitude ~20.7.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>INTEGRAL detected this 20 second long burst, and 23.3 seconds later (just 5 seconds after the alert was sent out!) the ROTSE IIIb observatory in western Texas spotted the rapidly fading afterglow. It was at magnitude 14.3 -- easily within the grasp of small off-the-shelf telescopes, and faded to magnitude 18.5 by about 20 minutes later. 

It has also been seen in the infrared-- interestingly, while it faded more than a magnitude in less than an hour (from 47 to 94 minutes after the burst), there is some evidence it got marginally brighter for a short time. The Cordell-Lorenz Observatory in Tennessee reports the afterglow faded 1.5 magnitudes (a factor of 4) in just over an hour as well.

The burst was observed with the Keck HIRES instrument, and they found a redshift for the burst of z=3.793, corresponding to a lookback time of about 12 billion years.

Swift observed this burst as a "Target of Opportunity", and took a 35,500 second exposure using the X-Ray Telescope. No afterglow was seen, which is unusual for this type of burst.</grb_description>

There has been a confirmed fading afterglow in the visible and infrared, though no detection in radio (UPDATE, 4/22/05: the afterglow was detected in radio, by the Very Large Array, 5.6 days after the initial burst). Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope began observing the burst just 65 seconds after it happened. 

Observations taken on June 6, 2005 using the giant Keck 10-meter telescope showed the GRB  host galaxy has a redshift of z=0.6535, corresponding to a lookback time of 6 billion years. The galaxy is faint and blue, and the spectrum indicates it has ongoing star formation. Analysis of the UVOT data gives a consistent redshift as well.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a long burst, lasting about 30 seconds, with many peaks in the emission. The burst had a very "hard" spectrum, meaning it gave off lots of high-energy X-rays, but was much fainter at lower energies. 

Swift's X-ray Telescope (XRT) has onboard software to let it find the source, but the burst was too faint in the kind of X-rays seen by the XRT to find automatically. A few hours later, ground-based analysis did clealry find a weak and fading source in the XRT data.

The burst is well-placed for follow-up observations. Two observatories report a very faint source (at about magnitude 21), but it is unclear if this is the optical afterglow of the burst or not because it is close to the limit of what can be seen. Most other observatories report detecting no afterglow.

The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on Swift initially reported a faint, rapidly fading UV source a few seconds after the burst, but it is well away from the position of the burst reported by the X-ray Telescope, and follow-up analysis has shown this may not be a real source. We await further analysis. No other source was seen by the UVOT in optical to a magnitude of 19.1. </grb_description>

The burst was faint, and unfortunately close to the position of the Earth in the sky as seen by Swift, so the satellite could not turn to observe it with the XRT and UVOT for about a half hour. A faint X-ray source was seen when Swift was able to finally observe it.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst lasted about 15 seconds, and is classified as an "X-ray rich" GRB, meaning it was very bright in X-rays. It was not initially detected by Swift, but Swift observed it about an hour after the event, and detected a bright X-ray source. 

An optical afterglow has also been spotted by several ground-based observatories. The Magellan/Clay telescope was able to determine a redshift of z=1.236 for the burst, which corresponds to a lookback time of 8.6 billion years. The Gemini telescope confirms this redshift, and even found indications that the interstellar gas in the burst host galaxy is relatively low in dust and high in heavy elements! This is unconfirmed, but interesting.

There was an initial report that the host galaxy had been previously observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a publicly-available catalog of sky objects (see http://www.sdss.org/ for more information). However, follow-up observations indicate that the galaxy seen is actually several arcseconds from the location of the burst and is unlikely to be the host.

Note added June 1, 2005: scientists looking at the Swift X-ray data have found what is a called a "jet-break", a change in the fading rate of the X-ray afterglow. It is thought that a key role in making a GRB is played by jets, focused beams of matter and energy emitted as the black hole forms. As a jet plows through the gas outside the exploded star, it eventually slows down and loses its focus, so it spreads out. This is the so-called jet break, and it can be used to determine the width of the beam. This in turn can be used to determine the *total* energy emitted by the GRB. In this case, they found the energy to be 10^52 ergs, or about 10 times the total energy emitted by the Sun *over its entire lifetime*!</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This event had an initial weak detection of gamma rays for about 3 seconds, followed by 30 more seconds of very low emission. Swift promptly slewed, and got observations using the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT). Both instruments detected a fading afterglow (in X-rays and in the UV, respectively). The Magellan telescope also saw a source in the red band (at 22nd magnitude) in images taken 8 hours after the event.

Astronomers suspect is was actually an "X-Ray Flash" (XRF), an event similar to a gamma-ray burst but with much lower energy. Scientists are not sure if XRFs are the same as gamma-ray bursts but seen at an oblique angle, or if they are an entirely different phenomenon. As always, more and better observations will help us understand these enigmatic phenomena.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This April fool's burst had five main peaks and lasted about 38 seconds. Swift had to delay slewing to the burst for a few seconds because it was too close to the Earth's position as seen by Swift. The burst was very bright in X-rays.

Two separate ground-based observatories report they had a marginal detection of the optical afterglow, one at 17th magnitude (just six seconds after the burst!) and the other at 20. It was also weakly detected in radio wavelengths by the Very Large Array in New Mexico a week after the initial burst, and more observations are planned.

The Very Large Telescope in South America reports they have found a redshift for this burst of z=2.90, which means it is at a distance of approximately 11.4 billion light years.

This burst was also detected by the Konus-WIND satellite.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was an unusual burst. It had six distinct peaks over the course of 30 seconds. The first peak was weak, and in fact it was the second peak, which was 10 times stronger, which triggered Swift. 

Swift was not able to look for an X-ray afterglow because initially the burst was too close to the position of the Earth as seen by Swift. Ironically, later on, Swift was out of contact with ground-based antennas for several hours due to the nature of its orbit, so further analysis must wait. 

However, XMM-Newton has observed this burst, looking for X-rays, and preliminary analysis reveals a previously-unseen source. We await further analysis.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>Swift found GRB050319A to have a fast rise and decay, lasting about 10 seconds. 

Swift's Optical/Ultraviolet Telescope was able to observe the afterglow, taking its first image just 140 seconds after the detection of the burst. A visual magnitude of 17.5 put this burst within the realm of amateur telescopes.

In fact, several ground-based telescopes in Japan saw the optical afterglow. One of those observations was made using a 14 inch telescope! We hope this encourages more amateur astronomers to pursue observing GRB afterglows. It was also observed by ROTSE just 27.1 seconds after Swift was triggered! In their first 5-second exposure, ROTSE got a magnitude of 16.2 for the burst, and saw it fade 1.5 magnitudes in the next 8 minutes. This is one of the best-observed light curves of any burst so far, thanks to Swift's rapid response. Ground-based observatories are still watching this fading afterglow.

Furthermore, the Nordic Optical Telescope reports that they have found a redshift for this burst of z=3.24, which corresponds to a lookback time of 11.6 billion years. A team of astronomers in Europe investigated the afterglow light in different colors, and confirmed the colors are consistent with a burst at this distance.</grb_description>

Swift also detected a fading optical afterglow. This marks the first time the UVOT has detected an afterglow from a burst!

Most importantly, this may be the second Swift burst to have its distance determined! The Magellan telescopes report a redshift of 1.949 from the spectrum of this burst, which corresponds to a lookback time of more than 11 billion years.

Note added 050419: Astronomers using the 1.54m Danish telescope at La Silla in Chile may have identified the host galaxy for GRB 050315. The galaxy is very faint, with an R (red) magnitude of about 24, one ten-millionth as faint as the faintest star you can see with the unaided eye. An image is available here: http://www.dsri.dk/~jgu/grb050315/FCs/GRB050315.R.Danish.medianw.gif. In this 7-hour exposure, the galaxy can be seen to be elongated.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was a very long GRB, lasting at least 180 seconds! Most long GRBs last only a fraction this of this time, indicating that this one was a bit of an oddball (which is saying a lot, given how odd GRBs are in the first place).

Even more, the number of incoming gamma rays peaked at least twice, and 165 seconds after the initial burst it looks like they were on the rise again (currently, only the first 180 seconds of the observation are available due to a downlink satellite telemetry issue; more will be forthcoming).

Swift has confirmed the detection of an X-ray afterglow. A ground-based observatory in Italy initially reported the observation of an extremely faint optical afterglow, but later analysis showed it to be a false detection. Swift could not observe this GRB initially using the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope because the burst was only 19 degrees from the Moon, which is too close to safely observe with the sensitive detectors. Observations taken 35 hours later showed no afterglow, however. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>This burst was detected by both the Swift and the INTEGRAL observatories. The burst was located too near the direction to the Earth as seen by Swift to be observed by the UV/Optical telescope right away, and those observations had to wait more than 45 minutes (no optical/UV afterglow was seen). Ironically, the burst occurred during a brief 3-minute time period when INTEGRAL was not sending out alerts either! However, the ground-based ROTSE telescopes did observe the burst a mere 7.7 seconds after receiving the alert from Swift. However, they detected no optical afterglow either.

The X-Ray Telescope onboard Swift did detect an X-ray afterglow, however. This prompted an observation by the joint European/NASA X-ray observatory XMM-Newton, which took a 60,000 second (16.7 hour) observation, and also detected the X-ray afterglow. More information can be found at http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/external/xmm_news/items/grb050223/index.shtml (warning: technical web page!). 

(Update March 17, 2005): The XMM-Newton data was significantly degraded by radiation during the observation, but astronomers report the source was fading during the observation. They are still working on cleaning up the data.

(Update July 3, 2006): Using the Magellan observatory, astronomers report a redshift of the host galaxy for this GRB of z=0.5915, corresponding to a look back time of 5.6 billion years.</grb_description>

However, the burst was seen by the X-ray Telescope, and was described as "fairly bright". There was no afterglow seen by the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope onboard Swift, however. No ground-based follow-up observations have yet been reported.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>This was the second burst detected by Swift on February 15, a mere 18 minutes after it detected GRB 050215a! This shows that the onboard software successfully interrupted itself to look for a new burst.

The UKIRT/UFTI facility(http://outreach.jach.hawaii.edu/articles/aboutukirt/) found a faint infrared source very close to the GRB position, glowing at about 20th magnitude. It faded a half magnitude by the next night. The Swift team reports a fading X-ray afterglow at the same position, confirming that this is the afterglow from the GRB. The afterglow was also detected using the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope onboard Swift.

The HETE-2 team reports that their data indicate this burst may have been an X-Ray Flash from a supernova, an exploding star. However, Swift has re-observed GRB050215B and has not detected a brightening source as expected for a supernova.</grb_description>

Interestingly, HETE-2 detected this burst just before it entered into a low-lying region of the Earth's van Allen Belts, called the South Atlantic Anomaly, or SAA. Due to increased radiation in that region, the automatic software on board the satellite can have a hard time processing the data, so it must be done manually.

		<grb_description>A bright infrared afterglow was detected by the Keck telescopes when they observed this burst 4.5 hours after the event. This infrared afterglow has been confirmed by the venerable 200-inch telescope at the Palomar observatory as well. In fact, the Keck telescope was able to get a distance to this GRB by determining its redshift, a first for a Swift burst! The redshift found is z=1.29 which translates into a distance of something like 12 billion light years. 

Interestingly, MASTER found no optical afterglow when they observed the GRB only 2.8 hours after the burst.

Swift repointed at the GRB 3 hours after the burst and detected a bright X-ray source which is assumed to be the afterglow. More data will be taken in the coming hours and days.

Follow-up observations by the giant Keck telescopes in Hawaii report a positive detection of the afterglow. A press release was issued by the Keck observatory at http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/news/science/swift/050214.html.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 050117 was a relatively long-duration burst, lasting about 3 minutes. It had several peaks in its brightness. No counterpart/afterglow has been detected in optical, near-infrared, or radio.

This burst is the first in history to be seen in X-rays while it was still bursting. Usually, X-ray telescopes cannot view bursts until well after they are over; the telescopes only see the afterglow. Because of Swift's built-in "swift" response time, scientists are getting a chance to see the X-rays from a burst for the first time. For more information, you can read a NASA press release about this event at http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/news/2005/05-019.html.</grb_description>

		<grb_description>GRB 041223 was long burst, with emission lasting just over two minutes. There were many small peaks of emission during the main burst. Scientists speculate that the smaller peaks are due to the energy from the event hitting and lighting up clouds of gas and dust surrounding the GRB's progenitor star.

Swift is currently (Dec. 24, 2004) not yet automatically moving to view bursts. So 4.5 hours after GRB 041223 was detected, Swift was manually commanded to move to put the burst in the field of the X-ray telescope. For the first time, Swift detected a fading afterglow in X-rays. 

Several other observatories report detections of an afterglow in infrared and optical as well. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>Astonishingly, Swift has detected a third burst in a single day! While this does not break a record, it does tie the BATSE detector that was on board the Compton Gamma ray Observatory, which once also recorded three bursts in one day. There were two clear peaks in this burst, for a total duration of 40 seconds. There may have even been an earlier burst 40 seconds earlier, but this was not well-located by Swift and may be unassociated with GRB 041219c. 

Observations by the PROMPT system taken 30 hours after the burst show no optical afterglow down to magnitude 20.4.</grb_description>

This event showed scientists that Swift is capable of performing the tasks for which it was built. </grb_description>

		<grb_description>The HETE Fregate and WXM instruments detected GRB 041006 (=H3570) at 12:18:08 UT (44288 SOD) on 06 October 2004.  The WXM flight software localized the burst in real time, resulting in a GCN Notice 42 seconds after the burst trigger.  The flight error region was a circle of 14 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) centered at

RA = 00h 54m 54s, DEC = +01d 18' 37" (J2000).

Ground analyses of the burst data allow the error region to be refined to a circle of 5.0 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) centered at

  RA = 00h 54m 53s, DEC = +01d 12' 04" (J2000).

Preliminary spectral analyses show the 2-30 keV fluence of GRB 041006 to be 5e-6 erg/cm2 and the 30-400 keV fluence to be 7e-6 erg/cm2:  the classification for GRB 041006 is, therefore, \"X-ray rich GRB\".

GRB 041006 is very similar to GRB 030329 in its lightcurve shape and spectral characteristics, although it is 20x fainter than GRB 030329. GRB 041006 shows a soft precursor before the main gamma-ray pulse.  The empirical redshift indicator for this burst is 0.4; for GRB 030329, it was 0.2.

		<grb_description>GRB 040924(=H3564):  A Short, Bright GRB Localized in Real Time by HETE

The HETE Fregate and WXM instruments detected GRB 040924 (=H3564) at 11:52:11 UT (42731 SOD) on 24 September 2004.  The WXM flight software localized the burst in real time, resulting in a GCN Notice 14 seconds after the burst trigger.  The flight error region was a circle of 14 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) centered at

  RA = 02h 06m 40s, DEC = +16d 08' 10" (J2000).

Ground analyses of the burst data allow the error region to be refined
to a circle of 6.4 arcminutes radius (90% confidence) centered at

  RA = 02h 06m 19s, DEC = +16d 01' 26" (J2000).

The burst is short, although not particularly hard:  the burst durations, as measured by T50, are 1.2s, 1.0s, and 0.6s in the 7-30 keV, 7-80 keV, and 30-400 keV bands, respectively.  Preliminary spectral analyses show GRB 040924 to have an Epeak of 42 +/- 6 keV.  The 7-30 keV fluence is 1.6e-6 erg/cm2, and the 30-400 keV fluence is 2.6e-6 erg/cm2:  the fluence ratio is 0.6, allowing us to classify GRB 040924 as an X-ray rich GRB.  The empirical redshift indicator (\"pseudo-z\"; Atteia 2003) for GRB 040924 is 0.5.

		<grb_description>At 16:21:37 UTC (58897 s UT) on 25 August 2004, the HETE FREGATE and WXM instruments detected event GRB040825B (=H3510), a long XRF. The burst triggered the WXM in the 2-30 keV energy band;  the burst duration was roughly 80 seconds.   A flight localization was automatically forwarded to the GCN 31 seconds after the trigger.  The flight localization was a circle of 14' radius centered at 
  RA = 22h 47m 22s,   Dec = -02d 19' 05" (J2000)

Subsequent analysis of the full data set allowed the burst error region to be reduced to a 160 sq. arcmin error box with the following coordinates, distributed by GCN Notice 1.8 hours after the trigger:

  RA = 22h 46m 38.9s, Dec = -02d 33m 40
  RA = 22h 46m 01.9s, Dec = -02d 29m 17s
  RA = 22h 46m 28.6s, Dec = -02d 15m 14s
  RA = 22h 47m 05.5s, Dec = -02d 19m 41s

Preliminary spectral analyses show the burst spectrum is well fit by a cutoff powerlaw model with an Epeak of 23 keV.  The burst fluence is 1.3e-6 erg/cm2 in the 2-30 keV band, 6.3e-7 erg/cm2 in the 30-400 keV band;  GRB040825B is therefore an XRF.

Further observations of this source are encouraged.
